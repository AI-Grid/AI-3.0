Revision History:
Outworldz "Dreamworldz" started in 2012 when it was used on a DVD and thumb drive to make a "Dream World" for a charity to give out as a thank you for donations.

This re-release updates it from the original Sim On A Stick format into a standalone app using 0.8.2.1 Diva Distro.  It removes the Mowes APP, PHP, and Apache (not needed).
