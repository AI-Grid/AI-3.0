Revisions for Dreamgrid

This is a high-level view of major changes. Revs such as 3.1 or 3.2 are releases and will trigger Update Is Available messages in the app. Anything with two or more digits such as 3.22 is a beta and will not trigger the "Update Is Available" Message.

Drop a useless old images to reduce size of exe
God mode fixes galore, reset defaults in Region INI to blanks
Added Overrides to Region List Details for carious Gods, Publicity and to skip region Auto Backup

V3.24
Updated to Released Opensim  "0.9.1.1 Yeti "Server Release Notes" hash #defa235859889dbd". This is one patch past 0.9.1.0 for server release notes.

V3.22
Shorten boot time by being smart about Firewall updates. On a very fast machine, it takes 9 seconds to get to robust start. Firewall took up 31 seconds more.  Now it takes 0 unless you add a region.
Restart Robust, Apache,Mysql and Apache if Auto restart is Enabled

V3.21 
Saving a region and them immediately re-opening it did not show changes. The changes were saved to disk but not reloaded into RAM.

Missing PHP7 extension prevented PHP from making maps, links or search.
Clearing asest cache when running did not work. It went to robust instead of the online regions. It worked if you were offline.
Added a Module for File/folder copy and delete to clean up warnings and catch all possible errors.
Apache Settings allowed both Local and Global search to be set. Now a toggle for one or the other.

V3.195
New updater process loads files in background to a specific zip file. You can choose to ignore this version. It will reprompt the next release.  
Dot Net zip set back to be 1.11.0 to be compatible with older updater. This causes a crash in the DLL.

V3.194
Big speed up on registering DYN DNS

V3.191
Stupid Oops in Regions,could not add a new region

V3.19 
Updated manual for upcoming 3.2 release
Fixed glitch in V3.18 in Cloud Density
Disallow Foreigners switch added per-region. This lets you keep assets in your grid by disallowing assets to leave, yet allowing HG visitors to come and go.
Disallow Resident switch added per-region. This allows only Region Owners and Estate Managers in any given region.
Checked all  IM vars against  opensim src and made minor changes thay may help with the offline IMs getting stuck.  Port 8003 should not need to be opened to allow IMs.

V3.18
Export Checkbox in Settings->permissions to disallow export of prims from viewers. Default -> Allow
If an OAR is loaded into a Var region > 4X4, allow it.
Removed lots of warnings in Visual Studio 2019.

V3.17 is a release candidate for V3.2, the official release that everybody gets a notice to update to.
There is no longer an "updater versus installer".  For backwards compatibility, there are still two files on the web server, but they are identical.  
If you want to start over with a blank database, you can just delete mysql\data and it will be rebuilt as a blank system
New backgound updater process.
"Welcome to " & SimName() & " , <USERNAME>") set for welcome message.
Build process is much faster by using a temp folder instead of adding and deleting from a  zip. Also easier to audit.

Console Commands did not always pop open the DOS window
Load OAR in some earlier versions was borked.
GDI+ error when changing Publicity Photo is fixed

V3.16 Beta
Search improvements for local and global search - sped up Datasnapshot interval, better HGV3 link that does not require a second click.  Shows # hours each sim has been online in search, and dwell time (the Second Life visitor metric).   

V3.15 Beta 
Opensim Snail dev master #38dbc0328881 2019-08-31 14:36
Ctrl-R Region Form also shows the Estate name for each region
Search: Lots of new things! Search is integrated into Hyperica.com.  You can look for Objects Marked for search in any Outworldz gird, or just your own. Also, locate Parcels, Grids and regions in grids. These are only sahown if the region owner chooses to enable search and the Prim Owner, region owner, or parcel owner has cheked the "Show in Search button".
Added a new variable to Opensim Datasnapshot module to allow all grids to be searched.
Disable Search button added to Viewer Search. If on, you can set it so your residents see local only, or globally Search all Dreamgrids.
Datasnapshot collector starts 5 minutes after a boot to speed up collecting assets for search. Runs every hour after that locally.
Some Settings would not be placed into the Region or Opensim.ini files when changed unless you did a restart.  Most changes to settings now re-write the region so it will boot correctly.
Import DDreamworld and "regular" Opensim INI files button in the Region Panel would not work if the file name did not match the [name] of the region. Fixed.
Changed Voice Help URL to match new Vivox web page for signup.
Windows can return a null PID from Process(). It should wait until there is a PID before returning. But nooooo it does not, so I added a fix to Boot () to make sure we have a valid PID so we can minimize windows. This may explain whey sometimes it does not type 'q' in certain windows.
Slow down the tests on quitting to prevent spamming the console.
Add more UPNP exception catchers to cover more brain-dead routers.
Major refactor of defaults for all region params to stop weird crashes on imported or brain-dead INI files.  For example, a sim size of 0 was allowed by Opensim INI files.  duh
Setting a new Publicity Photo could kill a system if the Hyperica server is offline or unreachable. Improve error handling here. There should be no dependency on any of my servers, except for optional services such as DYN DNS or search.
Updated Apache to latest security SSL/TLS 1.2 and made it refuse all obsolete ciphers like TLS 1.0 and 1.1.   Tested as not being viulnerable to any common attacks such as Heartbleed.

V3.13 Beta
Repaired OsGrid and other region types that broke in prior beta version
Added a Disable Gloebits setting in region settings. This overrides the global setting if Gloebits are on.
Refactored a lot of internal settings to use native types and also set defaults for all variables in Regions.

V3.12 Beta
Sped up Opensim using Ubi's optimized Dot Net bug fix for Windows 1903 and compiled with dev master #5b39860573 2019-08-02 12:13:53
Robust logging set to INFO, as it was too noisy in DEBUG
Added auto-updating Sitemap.xml for htdocs and bin/data
Added Web Statistics button for many statistics for each region in the Region Panel
Auto firewall setup was missing the second Icecast Port
Fixed an issue where Apache could not run properly on ports other than 80
Datasnapshot was not registering in Local Search mode, which broke Local Search, and used wrong http port if it was changed.

V3.11 Beta
Aviworlds Region Server lets you attach to Aviworlds easily.
Added Restart Robust Button
Added logic to catch UPNP errors on some machines/routers.

V3.1 Released 7/29/2019
Backup no longer blocks operation of the system
Backup FSAssets, too.
Xbakes enabled
IM Offline works without having to open port 8003.
Firewall code typo put an extra Apache Httpp Port 80 in the firewall every start.


V3.06
PHP Maps and Search working for any MYSQL port. Older systems used port 3309 as 3306 was use by some for Sim-On-A-Stick or OsGrid/Metro.
Use port 8003 for Offline IM to fix a problem where IMs would loop endlessly in the Console
Save IAR was non functional when all the Handles got dropped.
Save IAR needs to fiund a running region.  If the first region was found, the region was not popped up on screen. Old bug.
osGetGridGatekeeperURI enabled for teleport HUD by anybody.


V3.05 
Fixed doubled Auto teleports for Prim V2.5

V3.04 
Fixed a bug where the Auto Teleporters showed regions that are unmarked for teleports.
Opening Cache form with a lot of cache caused a very long pause. 
Fixed a case where Apache may not start reliably. 

V3.03
Added Help for FSAssets.
Added more visible help button to all forms.
Flotsam Cache variables can be changed to reduce disk space usage. See Settings->Caches.
System Backup has options for each type of backup to make and includes FSAssets data.
Added MinTimerInterval to each region INI file. Smallest value you should use is 1/11 of a second, as that is Opensims internal Frame rate. 

V3.02
Added Windows 1903 patches for Dot net 4.8 that caused many issues with MOAP, and changing land settings.
Checkbox to enable FsAssets - a disk based De-duplicating Asset Filesystem. I reommend you start your regions one at a time so they will be properly de-duplicated one time.
Reworked Region/Osgrid server to allow regions to have their own IP address.  Usually you do not need to do anything to run a region server except to
add the DNS name and change the setting. But this fails if the region server is on a different network.  See Ports section Help for details.
Auto Teleports now support multiple region servers.  Avatar counts will not work on Region servers - no access to the data unless you edit robust settings and grant access to the robust server with special Mysql commands.
Added a catch-all Error message handler for any missed exceptions to catch unexpected crashes.
Flotsam cache can be adjusted in size with a new panel.
Allow the Partners to work on region server.  Also updated the Steampunk TP and set the partners prinm to full mod/copy.
SupportViewerObjectsCache -= true explicitly to help with missing prims, theoretically this does nothiog as true is the default. See http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=8516

V3.01 
ExternalHostName added to the Port section for use on non-NATed Region servers.
Added Outworldz Teleport System V2.5.iar to the Local IAR. This teleporter supports more than 32 sims. Just change the description from 0 to 1, or 2 or 3, and reset the scripts.
Create Region Name could not be typed into at the ending.  Trim() fixed. 
Moved KillAll scripts towards end of boot, and made it run only once.
Lowered Cache sizes to 4 hr from 48 and made it adjustable.

V3.0 
Functionally the same as V2.96 with some additional Help file tweaks.

V2.96
Allow more than one LCD screen in the Auto re-positioner/resizer
Enable Xbakes
Server Visitor screens by Garry Beaumont in Local IAR

God mode for level 200+ incorrect also set Region Owner gods to on.

V2.95
Compiled with Opensim Master 6-8-2019 #38e937f91b08a2e52  
Helps fix fix prims not being seen ? if still losing them, lower your viewer bandwidth
Create inventory entries for textures uploaded with a model
MySQL could use up too many handles

Add Microsoft Runtime for Visual C++ 2012 32 and 64 bit


V2.94
Fix a case issue on Partners that broke partnering prim

V2.93
Auto detect any loopback adapter named "Loopback", and set it up when the grid starts.

Deletes all old DLLs that are not in the list 'dll.txt'.
Installs for Microsoft C++ 1012 32/64 bit which are needed for Apache.
A UUID could be zero'd out, leading to a crash.

V2.90
Release of V2.89 with another DLL deleted.

V2.89
Try-catch a possible crash on events load if Outworldz web site is offline. There should never be any dependencies on having an external PC running except for ns1.outworldz.net for dynamic DNS and that only applies to outworldz.net users. Dreamgrid pulls a list of available OARS, IARs, and events from Outworldz.com web site periodically, and these are dependent on Outworldz.com being online.
Removed bin\addins as it is old, unused, and may have old DLLS in it leading to mysterious crashes about log4net because log4net is now Dot net 4.6.

V.28
Add Gloebit back in.
Delete 11 DLL's left over from ancient updates.

V2.87
Compiled with Opensim Dev Master 4/24/2019  #11cad57c9cac5  
You should clear the script cache before starting this version as the large jump in Opensim code will likely lead to Script errors.
RegionReady set to localhost as Server2016 will run without Administrator mode.

V2.86 
Patched to fix Sequential Start. If on, nothing happened to delay the next sim from starting immediately but it should have waited for the previous sim to boot first, then start the next region.  If off, CPU less than 75% is needed before the next sim will start or stop.

V2.85 
Link to web page takes you to http://yourgrid:80where the large map is,  or 8002, depending upon whether Opensim is running, and if you have Apache webserver enabled. 
Apache port is movable. If your ISP blocks :80, try :8000
Diagnostics loopback test reworked for Server 2016.  
Icons fixed on Server 2016 by moving port 8001 to listen to localhost only.

V2.84 
Search local or remote grids is now a global setting. Global is still being edited, as it has no grid info yet.
Paging, search, sort by columns in Search Objects.
Events re-added by a pull from Outworldz e very hour and on startup

V 2.83
Apache 2.4 and PHP 5 added - may be enabled by a new switch in Web Control panel. You can run HTML and JavaScript with it or host your own Port 80 Web pages, assuming your ISP allows port 80.
Hypergrid.org?s ?MetroMap? (large and small) added to the url http:://(grid):80/Metromap and to the Wifi Home Screen.
You can run 3rd party programs such as PhpMyAdmin, Strawberry Perl and other CGI programs by adding the application.  
Perl examples for Template::Toolkit and DBIX::Class to manipulate the database are included in the Apache\htdocs\PerlExamples folder.
PHP Examples are in the Apache\htdocs\Search folder for Classifieds, Logging, Dumping Objects, Parcels, Regions, and Hosts.
Objects and regions marked as ?Show in Search? are Searchable in the Viewer (Ctrl-F in Firestorm). Requires Apache and PHP Switch to be enabled in Web Pages. Classifieds do not work yet.
Load OAR defaults to all options off.
New Auto-Restart on Crash switch enabled by default.
New Auto-Restart on Bulletsim Crash.
Memory leak plugged 
Sort order sorted for X,Y and RAM in Region Panel by adding leading zeros.
Faster startup started faster by skipping phase II settings unless you have edited something.
Predefined Colored logs
Enable these colored logs by selecting Save on Exit option ?To File in Application Directory? 

2.82 
Disabling a region while shutting it down caused the Regions panel to not render.
Help always appeared for Load Oar 2X2
Added a PopUp for 1X1 so you can set more options.
Added back the View buttons to Regionlist and made them resize and re-position the list

2.81
Add Memory used for each region to Region panel
Add RAM graph
Add Avatar, CPU and RAM to front panel
Save width for Main Form

2.8 Release  
2.79E = 2.8

2.79A through E:
Avatar count shown on main form at upper right.
Prompts before shutting down if any avatars are in any region. So you can deliberately kill then all! bwuhahaha
Clear Caches was in Help, now is a Settings Button for consistency.
Baretail logging system with colorized text, live scrolling.
"View All Logs" loads all logs into Baretail as tabs. Baretail.exe in the root folder remembers them.
"View Region Log" fixed to show the DOS box log instead of the region, which only worked on the last region in a DOS box.
Scrolling text in Status panel.
Resizable main form.
CPU speed graph for last 3 minutes.
Improved PC firewall ports opened on start.
Turns off the DOS box Quickedit mode. If you clicked a DOS box, it paused which eventually crashes the sim. Works on Private or Public Networks, not Domain.
Regions panel added an Avatar view that shows a list of avatar names and the regions they are in. Double-clicking a name will start a teleport sequence to that avatar in your viewer.
Region Panel remembers the last view set, and will reappear after a restart if it was open. 
Many changes to Recycling and Auto restart. More icons for recycling regions. Recycle up and recycle down are single blue arrows, Bootup and Shytdown are double Blue arrows.

2.78
The Log viewer 'baretail' is included. It lets you colorize text, is zippy fast, and auto-scrolls to the latest entry, like Unix tail does.
Capslock no longer interferes with console typing. I hate the CapLock Key.  
Load OAR options: 2x2, 3X3 and 4X4 clickable forms, with options for UserName & ForceMerge & ForceTerrain & ForceParcel & Displacement
Will abort Normalize regions if region locations will go negative or zero in X or Y.
Repositioned Web Maps for better fit to normalized region
Log level for robust set to INFO, instead of DEBUG, less spam, more speed.

2.77
Fix for Partners
Firewall Ports on PC are opened for you.
Robust 'create user' sent extra CRLF making it impossible to create the initial owner

2.76
Blank DNS name needs no password, becomes LAN IP.
Restart Region patch

Also, the Height and Width you last used are saved and restored.
Start/Stop/Restart All Buttons added to Region Panel
Region Chooser fixed to have New Name at top.

2.74 
Teleports 2.4 fix - these do not spam the console.  Does not require any settings to be set such as allow LSL scripts.  
Allow LSL when checked, scripts lets you manually edit the Allowed IP Addresses in Opensim.proto
Start Regions Sequentially:  Unchecked, the system starts a new region every few seconds. This can overwhelm the memory and CPU on slower systems.
UnChecked normally starts a new region if CPU is 75% or less. 
Checking this box will start them one at a time and wait for it to boot completely.  It will wait up up to 3 minutes per region, then move on.
Changes to Icecast ports or settings did not 'stick' would not overwrite file.
More Help on Loopback, Regions, Start/Stop

2.73
OAR filesave would dump one region into all OARS. not just one

Modules:
 - Web stats module for grid ops
 - Server Release Notes Module by Fly Man adds these notes to Help About
 - Auto Restart Module by Fly Man. You can Auto Restart regions automagically with a timer. If no avatars are in the region, it will auto-reset periodically. This clears RAM used by visitors and helps maintain stability. 240 minutes (4 hours) is the default.
 - Birds Module by jonc and Jak Daniels: 

There is an IAR called !OpensimBirds.iar? in the top of the Free Avatar Parts menu. Click it to load into your master avatar, just like any other IAR. To use this, log in and rez a bird from Objects/OpensimBirds. There are two types, SeaGull1 and SeaGull2.  Type this onto the region console:

birds-prim SeaGull1 <enter> (or use SeaGull2, whichever bird you have put out)
birds-start<enter>

 You should see a flock of birds fly around you and gather into a flock. 

 To make the birds auto fly, edit Outworldzfiles\Opensim\bin\startup_commands.txt.example and add the same commands. Save the file as "startup_commands.txt" and restart the system. Your birds will start to fly immediately.  This is System-Wide feature.  To make it per-region, move the Birds.ini file into Opensim\bin\Regions\<Groupname>\<SomeRegionName>.

birds-start - Start Birds Flocking to region Welcome
birds-enable - Enable Birds Flocking to region Welcome
birds-disable - Disable Birds Flocking to region Welcome
