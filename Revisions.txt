Modules:
 - Web stats module for grid ops
 - Server Release Notes Module by Fly Man adds these notes to Help About
 - Auto Restart Module by Fly Man. You can AutoRestart regions automagically with a timer. If no avatars are in the region, it will auto-reset periodically. This clears RAM used by visitors and helps maintain stability. 240 minutes (4 hours) is the default.
 - Birds Module by jonc and Jak Daniels: 

There is an IAR called ?!OpensimBirds.iar? in the top of the Free Avatar Parts menu. Click it to load into your master avatar, just like any other IAR. To use this, log in and rez a bird from Objects/OpensimBirds. There are two types, SeaGull1 and SeaGull2.  Type this onto the region console:

birds-prim SeaGull1 <enter> (or use SeaGull2, whichever bird you have put out)
birds-start<enter>

 You should see a flock of birds fly around you and gather into a flock. 

 To make the birds auto fly, edit Outworldzfiles\Opensim\bin\startup_commands.txt.example and add the same commands. Save the file as "startup_commands.txt" and restart the system. Your birds will start to fly immediately.  This is System-Wide feature.  To make it per-region, move the Birds.ini file into Opensim\bin\Regions\<Groupname>\<SomeRegionName>.

Console commands:

birds-start - Start Birds Flocking to region Welcome
birds-enable - Enable Birds Flocking to region Welcome
birds-disable - Disable Birds Flocking to region Welcome
birds-size <num> - Adjust the size of the flock to region Welcome
birds-prim <name> - Set the prim used for each bird to that passed in to region Welcome
birds-speed <num> - Set the maximum velocity each bird may achieve to region Welcome
birds-force <num> - Set the maximum force each bird may accelerate to region Welcome
birds-distance <num> - Set the maximum distance that other birds are to be considered in the same flock as us to region Welcome
birds-separation <num> - How far away from other birds we would like to stay to region Welcome
birds-tolerance <num> - How close to the edges of things can we get without being worried to region Welcome
birds-stats - Show birds stats to region Welcome
birds-framerate <num> - [debugging] only update birds every <num> frames to region Welcome
