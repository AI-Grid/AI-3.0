2.82 
Disabling a region while shutting it down caused the Regions panel to not render.

2.81

2.8 Release  
2.79E = 2.8

2.79A through E:
Avatar count shown on main form at upper right.
Prompts before shutting down if any avatars are in any region. So you can deliberately kill then all! bwuhahaha
Clear Caches was in Help, now is a Settings Button for consistency.
Baretail logging system with colorized text, live scrolling.
"View All Logs" loads all logs into Baretail as tabs. Baretail.exe in the root folder remembers them.
"View Region Log" fixed to show the DOS box log instead of the region, which only worked on the last region in a DOS box.
Scrolling text in Status panel.
Resizable main form.
CPU speed graph for last 3 minutes.
Improved PC firewall ports opened on start.
Turns off the DOS box Quickedit mode. If you clicked a DOS box, it paused which eventually crashes the sim. Works on Private or Public Networks, not Domain.
Regions panel added an Avatar view that shows a list of avatar names and the regions they are in. Double-clicking a name will start a teleport sequence to that avatar in your viewer.
Region Panel remembers the last view set, and will reappear after a restart if it was open. 
Many changes to Recycling and Auto restart. More icons for recycling regions. Recycle up and recycle down are single blue arrows, Bootup and Shytdown are double Blue arrows.

2.78
The Log viewer 'baretail' is included. It lets you colorize text, is zippy fast, and auto-scrolls to the latest entry, like Unix tail does.

Start/Stop/Restart All Buttons added to Region Panel
Region Chooser fixed to have New Name at top.

2.74 
Teleports 2.4 fix - these do not spam the console.  Does not require any settings to be set such as allow LSL scripts.  
Allow LSL when checked, scripts lets you manually edit the Allowed IP Addresses in Opensim.proto
Start Regions Sequentially:  Unchecked, the system starts a new region every few seconds. This can overwhelm the memory and CPU on slower systems.
UnChecked normally starts a new region if CPU is 75% or less. 
Checking this box will start them one at a time and wait for it to boot completely.  It will wait up up to 3 minutes per region, then move on.
Changes to Icecast ports or settings did not 'stick' would not overwrite file.

Modules:
 - Web stats module for grid ops
 - Server Release Notes Module by Fly Man adds these notes to Help About
 - Auto Restart Module by Fly Man. You can AutoRestart regions automagically with a timer. If no avatars are in the region, it will auto-reset periodically. This clears RAM used by visitors and helps maintain stability. 240 minutes (4 hours) is the default.
 - Birds Module by jonc and Jak Daniels: 

There is an IAR called ?!OpensimBirds.iar? in the top of the Free Avatar Parts menu. Click it to load into your master avatar, just like any other IAR. To use this, log in and rez a bird from Objects/OpensimBirds. There are two types, SeaGull1 and SeaGull2.  Type this onto the region console:

birds-prim SeaGull1 <enter> (or use SeaGull2, whichever bird you have put out)
birds-start<enter>

 You should see a flock of birds fly around you and gather into a flock. 

 To make the birds auto fly, edit Outworldzfiles\Opensim\bin\startup_commands.txt.example and add the same commands. Save the file as "startup_commands.txt" and restart the system. Your birds will start to fly immediately.  This is System-Wide feature.  To make it per-region, move the Birds.ini file into Opensim\bin\Regions\<Groupname>\<SomeRegionName>.

Console commands:

birds-start - Start Birds Flocking to region Welcome
birds-enable - Enable Birds Flocking to region Welcome
birds-disable - Disable Birds Flocking to region Welcome
birds-size <num> - Adjust the size of the flock to region Welcome
birds-prim <name> - Set the prim used for each bird to that passed in to region Welcome
birds-speed <num> - Set the maximum velocity each bird may achieve to region Welcome
birds-force <num> - Set the maximum force each bird may accelerate to region Welcome
birds-distance <num> - Set the maximum distance that other birds are to be considered in the same flock as us to region Welcome
birds-separation <num> - How far away from other birds we would like to stay to region Welcome
birds-tolerance <num> - How close to the edges of things can we get without being worried to region Welcome
birds-stats - Show birds stats to region Welcome
birds-framerate <num> - [debugging] only update birds every <num> frames to region Welcome
