Annnouncing DreamGrid V2.31

Made from OpenSimulator 0.9.1.dev.24df1086fa 05-24-2018 (same as OsGrid)

Suitcase or No Suitcase? A suitcase protects your inventory from rogue grids. When you are on another grid, you can only access what is in your suitcase. You can now disable the suitcase and rez objects from anywhere in your inventory while on foreign grids.
Prim limits: Opensimulator can enforce a prim limit. Landlords can enable it to enforce MAXPRIMS on each parcel. MAXPRIMS can be set in each Region panel under 'More'
DataSnapshot for any prims marked as "show in Search". This replaces the broken Diva search. It works across all DreamGrids.
 - Prim Info (location, for sale, etc.) is sent to http://hyperica.com/. The actual search engine is under development. Enable this in Settings-Expert at bottom left corner.
 - Classified ad will soon be possible across the Outworldz.
Mail Exposed more SMTP email server settings than just Gmail.
Publicity Upload an image and description to Hyperica.com's Hypergrid list.

Modules:
 - Web stats module for grid ops
 - Server Release Notes Module by Fly Man adds these notes to Help About
 - Auto Restart Module by Fly Man. You can AutoRestart regions automagically with a timer. If no avatars are in the region, it will auto-reset periodically. This clears RAM used by visitors and helps maintain stability. 240 minutes (4 hours) is the default.
 - Birds Module by jonc and Jak Daniels: 

There is an IAR called “!OpensimBirds.iar” in the top of the Free Avatar Parts menu. Click it to load into your master avatar, just like any other IAR. To use this, log in and rez a bird from Objects/OpensimBirds. There are two types, SeaGull1 and SeaGull2.  Type this onto the region console:

birds-prim SeaGull1 <enter> (or use SeaGull2, whichever bird you have put out)
birds-start<enter>

 You should see a flock of birds fly around you and gather into a flock. 

 To make the birds auto fly, edit Outworldzfiles\Opensim\bin\startup_commands.txt.example and add the same commands. Save the file as "startup_commands.txt" and restart the system. Your birds will start to fly immediately.  This is System-Wide feature.  To make it per-region, move the Birds.ini file into Opensim\bin\Regions\<Groupname>\<SomeRegionName>.

Console commands:

birds-start - Start Birds Flocking to region Welcome
birds-enable - Enable Birds Flocking to region Welcome
birds-disable - Disable Birds Flocking to region Welcome
birds-size <num> - Adjust the size of the flock to region Welcome
