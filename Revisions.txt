Revision History:
Outworldz "Dreamworldz" started in 2012 when it was used on a DVD and thumb drive to make a "Dream World" for a charity to give out as a thank you for donations.

This re-release updates it from the original Sim On A Stick format into a standalone app using 0.8.2.1 Diva Distro and 0.9.0 dev.  It removes the Mowes App that points to a hacked web site, PHP, and Apache (none of them are needed and are security risks).
