Swanlake

Idea and developed by Avia Bonne 2018.
An imaginairy region was created with 2 mixed stories about Swanlake & Black Swan, both a famous ballet and a movie.

The meshpieces I used are all free downloaded from Yobi3D.com a free searchengine for free mesh.
I converted the pieces and edited them into other objects to create the region as how it is.
I used 3 freebie objects as well to decorate, so thanks goes to Oddball O'tool, Jeff Hall and Nebadon Uzumi for their work.

3 NPC- ballerinacharacters are hidden by transparency, you have to go into the transparencymodus to find the balls and hit to activate if they don't work immediately by start. (View, Highlight transparency)
You need OSSL function enabled at your sim to run the NPC's.

For those who love Art and Ballet, enjoy the beauty!
