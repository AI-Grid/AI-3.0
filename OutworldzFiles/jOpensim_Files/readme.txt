This is the entire Joomla/Jopensim project: 

There is no need to unzip any files. See the Setup->Setting->Joomla tab in Dreamgrid and click the Help button to learn how these files are used.

kickstart.php and en-GB.kickstart.ini are used to restore *.jpa files.
Joomla_{version}-Stable-Full_Package.zip contains the src for Joomla.
pkg_opensim.{version}.zip contains the latest Jopensim.
Joomla+JopensimV{x}.jpa  contains the suggest Opensim website. It is restored with kickstart.php

The pkg_opensimincludes the current modules (mod_opensim_events, mod_opensim_friends, mod_opensim_regions, mod_opensim_gridstatus and mod_opensim_admin) and the plugins (plg_jopensimregister and plg_jopensim_quickicon). There is no need to unzip the file first. This zip will install it all in one go!
