If it crashes, check that you have the latest graphics drivers:

    ATI/AMD drivers are at http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/Pages/index.aspx
    NVIDIA drivers are at http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx
    Intel drivers are at http://www.intel.com/p/en_US/support/graphics

The following procedure, called a clean install, will often fix problems related to graphics cards and drivers:

    Download the latest graphics driver from the chipset manufacturer (ATI, Nvidia, or Intel), not the maker of your graphics card or computer. Save the file where you can easily find it, but do not install it yet.
    Run Windows Update and make sure your system is fully patched.
    Reboot your computer and enter Safe Mode by pressing F8 at the Windows logo screen.
    Uninstall your old video driver. On Windows XP use Control Panel > System > Hardware > Device Manager (steps will be different on other operating systems). Then open Display Adapters, right-click and choose Uninstall.
    Reboot your computer.
    If Windows displays a message that it found new hardware, do not let it automatically install drivers. Instead, run the installation program that you downloaded in step 1.
    Reboot your computer
