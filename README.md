An easy and complete installer for standalone hypergrid Opensimulator for Windows.  It is licensed as AGPL 3.

OpenSimulator is normally not easy to run and install. This automates setup pre-set with grid info, ready to go.

Upon completion of setup, the program displays a Start button which boots up MySQL, Opensim, the Wifi Web Interface and the viewer, ready to log in.  

A third click will close everything down.
