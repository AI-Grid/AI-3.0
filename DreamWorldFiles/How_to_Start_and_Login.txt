Sim-on-a-Stick OpenSim 0.8PF (post fixes - Aug 10, '14)


For standard installer users -

1) double-click the mowes desktop shortcut and allow it to launch
2) double-click OpenSim desktop shortcut and allow it to launch*

If shortcuts fail, navigate to c:\SoaS08PF folder and follow steps 2 and 3 below.


For zip file users -

1) navigate to the SoaS08PF folder you unzipped
2) launch mowes.exe
3) launch \diva-r25084\bin\OpenSim.exe (32-bit operating systems) OR \diva-r25084\bin\OpenSim.32BitLaunch.exe (64-bit operating systems)



After OpenSim has fully started, use your favourite viewer with the following grid and login information:

login URI: http://127.0.0.1:9100/
User First Name: Simona
User Last Name: Stick
Password: 123



* - the OpenSim shortcut launches OpenSim.exe which now works for both 32-bit and 64-bit operating systems. However, if you experience crashing on a 64-bit operating system, try using \diva-r25084\bin\OpenSim.32BitLaunch.exe instead.



To create additional users, with mowes and OpenSim running, use the WifiAdminPanel shortcut or paste the link below into your web browser:
