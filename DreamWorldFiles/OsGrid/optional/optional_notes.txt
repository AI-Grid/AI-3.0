OpenSim.exe.config
OpenSim.32BitLaunch.exe.config

These files will allow you to minimize logging and console output, it will also rotate your logs every 25mb of logging and seperate the Xengine output to its own log.  When your sim starts you will not see Xengine print any script logging on the console, this is normal, infact console and log output will be minimized when these files are installed. This can improve performance on busy simulators.  To install these files just copy them into your /bin folder where OpenSim.exe or OpenSim.32BitLaunch.exe exists.
