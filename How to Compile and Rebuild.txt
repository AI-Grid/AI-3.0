INTRODUCTION 

The system supports a special installer that will put a easy-to-use copy of a custom OpenSim and the Onlook viewer on a Windows machine.    It is written in VB.Net 2010.

Multiple copies of different simulations can be made and distributed via DVD, download, or thumb drive. 

File structure: 

Each folder has specific purposes. Some are used for distribution, others hold source code or output from compilers.

The following folders must be in any distributed zip, thumb, or DVD.  
   DreamWorldFiles - Contents is a 0.8.0 "Sim On A Stick". 
   Viewer:  The easy to use Onlook viewer

Installer-Src - Hold Source code for the Start.exe 

Making A Different Installation: 

Everything that makes a sim unique is located in a single folder "DreamWorldFiles".   It is essentially a copy of the default SoaS installation with modifications to make it easy to install and ready to use.  

The installer will not work without one key modifications:   A copy of  "Up.html" which contains the single word "Up' is added to DreamWorldFiles\Opensim\bin\WifiPages to check that the sim is up.

You can copy the folder "DreamWorld"  make changes to the copy and database by logging in, adding content, or editing files to make different setups.  

The bottom of Opensim.ini has a configured Autobackup module.  You must create an Autobackup folder in your Opensim bin folder to accomodate this.

 [AutoBackupModule]
    AutoBackupModuleEnabled = true
    AutoBackup = true
    AutoBackupInterval = 1440
    AutoBackupBusyCheck = false
    AutoBackupThreshold = 1
    AutoBackupSkipAssets = false
    AutoBackupKeepFilesForDays = 120
    AutoBackupNaming = Time
    AutoBackupDir = "AutoBackup"


The bottom of Opensim.ini  has the CameraOnlyModeModule and SpecialUIModule. These values are changed dynamically by the installer


  [CameraOnlyModeModule]
  
  ;# include the camera versus avatar settings. The Dreamworld installer will change this file as needed
  enabled = true
  
  ;; Users with UserLevel equal or less than this will be sent this mode.
  ;; Others above will not.
  UserLevel = 0
  
  [SpecialUIModule]
  enabled = true
  
  ;; Users with UserLevel equal or less than this will be sent this mode.
  ;; Others above will not.
  UserLevel = 0



Backups 

The database will grow and grow!   So before you make any changes, you should make a backup copy of "DreamWorldFiles" folder.     Do not use the original folder for live work.    

Compiliation:  You need to use Microsoft Visual Basic 1010 to 2015.  Navigate to \Installer-Src\2010\SetupDreamWorld and open the Solution "Setup DreamWorld.sln"

Navigate to Debug->Build Start. The app should compile.   Navigate to "Installer-Src\2010\SetupDreamWorld\Setup DreamWorld\bin\Release" and copy Start.exe and Start.Application to \DreamworldFiles to be ready for production.

You can run Start.exe with the command line option 'clean' and it will delete extra data that Opensim does not need in a distribution, such as cache and script folders
