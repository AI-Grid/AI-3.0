"Epic Castle" is a nice demonstration of a complex mesh model
that can be imported into OpenSim, and saved as an OpenSim Archive
(OAR) file that others can load and use. In this instance the castle
was created and freely released by Epic Games to demonstrate the
Unreal Engine. It was imported to OpenSim and provided as an OAR for
others to enjoy by Cuteulala Artis. She scaled it for a single
256x256m region, but notes it needs to be scaled up (perhaps onto a
2×2 area or 512x512m varregion) to allow better scaling and so avatars
can get through the doors.
