The Swamp oar

This Swamp was made in 2010, and was made mostly with prims and some sculpts.
I rebuild it all with more mesh and removed many oldschool-prims to reduce lag.
I think the Writershouse is the only original building I left there, because I love it so much;-)
I added many new spots and funny creatures. It has lots of nice relaxing places as well, but you have to find them.

The meshpieces I used are all free downloaded from Yobi3D.com.
I converted the pieces and edited them into other objects or used them as decor.

3 Frogs are dancing at a pond. 
If they don't start, you need to activate them by touching the npc-balls.
Go into the transparent mode for this.
You need OSSL function enabled at your sim to run the NPC's.

The NPC script I used is written by Aine Caoimhe.
Some objects are made by creators like Ferd Frederix, Arcadia Asylum, Boba Solo and Falene Hawks. 
Thanks to them I could share them here for some extra pretty decor!
