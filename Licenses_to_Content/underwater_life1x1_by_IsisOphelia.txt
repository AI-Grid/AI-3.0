IMPORTANT	
Items collected in the Hyperverse.  In the Description is the name that appeared as creator, 
when I picked it up. Some items had a License or Terms of Use in Content. Do not delete the 
names in Descriptions (except if you know for sure who created them) and leave the Notecards 
in Content, when you give an item to someone else. Any item not legal? Please notify me to 
remove it from the oar and from my Inventory.
The content in this oar is full perms.
You can add Mermaids NPCs. I was not allowed to do it, because the animations are "no 
transfer". You can pick up the mermaid avatars and AO from here:
Creator: Lacchi.Macchi @hypergrid.org:8002 
hypergrid.org:8002:Aqua Dark 
Inside the Credits board are the needed tools to create your Mermaids. Read the Instructions.
Lounge Chairs: 
With MLP animations system. Touch to start the system after you loaded the oar. 
After the system is full loaded, go to Options/Ballusers set to ALL to let your visitors use the 
furniture. I would leave MenuUser to only the owner.
Under Water Rock Seats 
Right click to sit. Touch the rock to bring up the menu to chose a sit-animation.
Under water are sunken shifs, a destroyed plane, sunken cementary, a mermaids house, a cave, 
swimming fishes, turtles and sharks.
