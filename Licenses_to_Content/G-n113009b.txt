Everything is completely of my creation, including the terrain. 
The main attraction is my sculpty tube tunnel, give it a fly-through or just walk through it for some fun.
Also a wood tower, and the Unofficial OSGrid 2nd Birthday Bash Flying Banner Airplane!
The terrain is a nice full-size terraced island with a small island in the corner. It has a max. terrain height of 36 meters, of course you can tweak that in the console or inworld.
