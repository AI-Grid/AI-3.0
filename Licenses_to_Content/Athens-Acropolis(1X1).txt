This OAR file contains terrain modeled on the Athens Acropolis, a model of the Theatre of Dionysus built by Erik N. and a model of the Parthenon built by about 40 8/9th grade students in their geometry class in 2010. The models are built to scale, which was the point of having students do it as a geometry activity. The only thing that is way off is the Acropolis itself, which should be about twice as big, but it would have far exceeded the boundaries of a single 256 x 256 meter region.
