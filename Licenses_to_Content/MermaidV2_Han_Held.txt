Most of the items are Linda Kellie's with her blessing. Several modifications made and items placed above and below water.

Sunbeam Magic created thje Mermaid Club, Han Held created a Submarine to live in, "Owl" contributed a nice yacht, and Shelenn contributed some textures. Some "special" items included also-))

There are several useful scripts in this and it will be most especially useful in opensim but also in Kitely. Several items may need to be reset.

This is a mostly water terrain of course but includes islands nicely landscaped. A multi-purpose terrain created by Minethere Always, it will find use all by itself.

Please enjoy this gift from all of us-))"
