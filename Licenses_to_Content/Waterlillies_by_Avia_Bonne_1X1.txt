Waterlillies

Inspired by Efteling Waterlillies at the Netherlands, a very famous attraction there.

The meshpieces I used are all free downloaded from Yobi3D.com.
I converted the pieces and edited them into other objects to create the region as how I wanted it to be.

3 NPC-waternymphs are dancing inside the waterlillies. 
If they don't start, you need to activate them by touching the npc-balls.
You need OSSL function enabled at your sim to run the NPC's.

The NPC script I used is written by Aine Caoimhe.

Idea and developed by Avia Bonne 2018.
