This is a fun “General” rated sim. Have the feel of being at the beach with little beach shops and two piers and fun rides. The rides all work but scripts will probably need to be reset after the first time you load the OAR. The game huts are not scripted and are just for looks.

I have created this sim using my own builds, animations, textures and such. This is a large file and may take awhile to download.  For instructions on how to load an OAR file go HERE. Below you can see a few snapshots of what the sim looks like.

Take this apart and use just what you need or use the whole sim just as it is. Do anything you want with any of it. It’s all free with no TOS and no Rules. Treat it as your own because once you download it then it will be your own.

Disclaimer: I am not responsible for the content you offer to your grid. Once you download this you must make sure that you go through it and take out anything that doesn’t fit with the age group for your grid.

NOTE: Once the OAR is loaded on your grid you may need to reset scripts in the scripted items (poseballs, rides,  furniture). Edit the item and choose “tools” from the upper menu bar an then choose “reset scripts in selected”.
