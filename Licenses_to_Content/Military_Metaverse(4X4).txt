The soldier patrol region is a circuit path for people to experience five different mini-scenarios that a soldier may encounter while on patrol.  This region was created to demonstrate the rapid scenario generation capabilities of the MOSES platform.  The region was created from existing assets as well as newly created items in under 3 weeks.
