Naval Station OAR
by STUDMEISTER on Oct 12, 2013 
I created this OAR on my personally hosted Regions. I designed it to look like a Naval Station with 2 warehouses and a Command and Control center. The only thing missing is the ships to put in the Docks. You may use as you wish, I do not care. The 2 warehouses and Command and Control Center were created by someone else. I have the same buildings on an OAR that this other person put on, but the Docks, and ground prims, I built, as well as the terraforming that has been done.


I hope you like it.

Sincerely,

Studmeister Studley
