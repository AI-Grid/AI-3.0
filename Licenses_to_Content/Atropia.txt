The Atropia region was used for the STTC/Intel Distributed Scene Graph experiments in the summer of 2013.
This was a role play scenario set in the fictional town of Brentville where people could experience life 
s a soldier on patrol, a local resident bound to tradition and civil law, or an outlaw trying to make a
living through nefarious means. These OAR files provide the 9 sims that made the Atropia region.
