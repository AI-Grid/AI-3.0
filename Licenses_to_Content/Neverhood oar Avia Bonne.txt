The Neverhood

About the oar;

An old skool sim I made in 2010 at OSGrid,  as a shoppingcentre in the style of a slumcity.
Some even remembered it as The Slumcity ;-)
Garry Beaumont asked me to offer it as a freebie oar.
For me it is old skool, (read crap) but hey, who am I to judge?
If I can make someone happy with it, then I am happy too.

In some stores you can find freebies of Garry Beaumont, Elmo Figaro, Arcadia Asylum and me.
The rest of the stores you can fill yourself, or just leave it as a ghosttown.
Great thanks to these Open Sim creators for sharing their creations at the Neverhood!
