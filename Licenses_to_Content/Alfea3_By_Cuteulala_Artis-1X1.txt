I must be out of my mind to release this??? nahh here ya go! enjoy. A winx
club themed sim thats preety and awsome layout. Alfea is one of the coolest
sims i made yet its very nintendo like with a fantasy setting. As always have fun!

There are known issues i am fully aware of such as on loading the oar you will
get spammed with 99 messages about a script just close them all!

You May Not use the name Alfea in this region as its being used by me thanks!
The sim is targeted twards children but also adults
