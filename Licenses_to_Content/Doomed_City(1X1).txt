Description:   A contribution for the August Challenge of OpenSim Creations (http://opensim-creations.com/2013/08/05/august-challenge-fantasies/). 
               Inspired by a comicbook from Don Lawrance, we created his "Doomed City" in a virtual 3D world. 
			   It is about 350 meters high and you can walk through this world and with an elevator you can 
			   enter the city itself.
			   Textures are all own or from Open Domain sources. The object is created in an OpenSimulator Virtual 3D World (OpenSim 0.7.5 RC1) 
			   and exported with Cool VL Viewer (v1.26.6) No scripts are included.
			   If you use it in your own environment, please sent an image to me.
