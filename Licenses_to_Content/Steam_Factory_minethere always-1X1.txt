3152 prims 504 scripts 43 mg file size

This OAR has a direct contribution of items built and placed by Sunbeam Magic.

I did the terrain and added some items I built.

Permissions allowed for content by several content creators. Some items are specifically requested not to be resold.

However, nobody is going to be looking for issues...so we all only ask the people use this in the spirit given, that of it remaining free to keep and free to give out-))

There is some amazing content in this, created with care and freely done. Many odds and ends of scripts as well. Keep in mind it is those people who did the main work here, and give it all free. I only put it together in a nice OAR. Any credit should rightfully go to them and many items have in their contents or descriptions who those ppl are.

The attribution notecard prim is in the freebie Church, please review that. If any person should complain about content it is best to be nice and simply contact the content creators themselves, directly. This avoids issues getting out of control-))

I am primarily the organizer and in charge of overall placement and design. Specific content issues should be directed to the builders themselves. As well, you may likely make a new friend-))
