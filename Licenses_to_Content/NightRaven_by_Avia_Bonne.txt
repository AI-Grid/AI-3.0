NightRaven is a futuristic dancearea with dancing npc's, flying eggs, flowersits, rotating stars, creative meshdecor and a starterspoint/teleporter.

The NPC- characterballs are hidden by transparency, you have to go into the transparencymodus to find them and hit to activate if they don't work immediately by start. (View, Highlight transparency)

You need OSSL function enabled at your sim to run the NPC's.

The npc-scripts I used for the characters are made by Aine Caiomhe. I've placed a stop box for the npc's to stop them if you click on the box.

Idea and developed by Avia Bonne, July 2018.
