These OAR-files are the complete backup of the 4freedom sim on OSgrid.

4 Freedom is a group of individuals that promote and spread freedom in Second Life and OpenSim based grids like OSGrid and Newworldgrid. 
The ideas of freedom are based on the ones of Free Software Foundation.

The sim is full of truly free items.
From more manny sources.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How do I use the OpenSim Archive Function:
On your server go to the bin directory and place the file there.
To load an archive, type  in the opensim console
	load oar [oarnamehere]
It will take a while to completely load it.
Its meant to be all full perm as statet in the copyleft lisence.
If by mistake something isnt full perm you can use the god tooles to force full perm.

Thanx to the whole 4freedom group, OSgrid, Nebadon, opensim-creations.com and manny more.

Enjoy
