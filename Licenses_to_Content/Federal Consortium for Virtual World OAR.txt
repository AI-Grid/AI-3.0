The Federal Consortium for Virtual Worlds (FCVW) lobby was used to introduce new users on how to maneuver within the virtual environment during the 2015 FCVW conference. This region was set up using predefined sections to help guide users through the process of walking, flying, getting dressed, and finally customizing their avatar’s appearance. Upon completion of the basic introduction training, conference attendees would travel to other virtual locations to participate in the various workshops of the conference.
