Anawigi's Garden
 by Iris Dolphin
of Dolfins Dream World

Anawigi's garden was set up in December of 2014 for my Sister Anawigi. She passed away form 
Brest Cancer in August of that same year. She love the Virtual Worlds so very much. she was a wonderful 
creator and helped lots of people set up their lands on Second Life and in InWorldz. She loved
being able to create things and Sell them or mostly give them away.
She fought hard against the Cancer but lost her battle.


I wish to thanks the many contribitures that help with the items in Anaiwigi's Garden
including Anawigi who made the Lighthouse before her passing. I would also like to thank
