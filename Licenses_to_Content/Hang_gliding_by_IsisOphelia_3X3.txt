Thanks to the big help of +Leighton Marjoram, imagine that, he has been helping me with this issue since 4
hours ohboy and he had the great thought to test the oar in a 0.8.2 installation. So now we know that the 1st oar was and is ok.
For those running on 0.8.2.1 but those on 0.9 will not get the mesh vulcano. You will need to pick it up
and position it. I have set a box with it and gave the coordinates to place it in the right spot.

It is right besides the opensimworld beacon and Visionz tracks.

I'm glad to have finished this one. What started as a place for me to fly my hang glider, turned to a
3x3 region with waterways. Not for high-speed-sailors, it's more for the kind of Sundays sailing. Please take
the time to read the Credits graphic before you download. 

The oar has around 6k prims, with enough areas to decorate yourself. For example you could add a raft
with animations in the cave or furnish the tudor houses and let your SL best friends live there for a while. The Marina C
                lub has some basic club stuff. The best thing of this oar is that you can delete it at any time lol
Forgot to mention. I placed teleport tiles without tp script, because positions would change in your
grid. Just insert your tp script and configure. The hang glider platform has a TP down script, you will need to change coords.
