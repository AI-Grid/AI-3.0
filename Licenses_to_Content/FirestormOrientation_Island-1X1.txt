This is a viewer orientation Island by Andrew Chapman.

Andrew Chapman of YourInside has released two free Orientation oars, one for SIngularity and one for Firestorm users.
You travel underwater past a series of images that show you how to use the various menus of each product.

He says "I am developing a series of regions, of which I have 2 called Orientation, for Firestorm and for Singularity.
They are designed for newcomers, to get the basics of how to do things. I would like to release these to the community
through your outlet as an add-on service. Totally free as a thank you for sharing."
