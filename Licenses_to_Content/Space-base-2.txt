Space Base Workstage - v2
By Ener Hax: http://enerhax.com/oars/spacebase.html

Need a place to use as a workshop? that's what this freebie is intended for!

A big 78 metre circular platform to build objects on - literally an empty stage where you can build discrete objects just as you'd use a workshop

The ship is posed in two ways - one as a landed craft on some alien island and the other directly above as if hovering or blasting off. delete one, mod the other, keep 'em both - it's your workshop!

You can visit it online at Kitely at http://www.kitely.com/virtual-world/Ener-Hax/Space-Base-Workstage-freebie and check out the pop top! The dome rises out of the way with a touch and then closes on another touch to keep your work safe (and fresh!)

v2 adds stage lighting, rocks, and plants, and safety rails at stage edges plus a small moon!
