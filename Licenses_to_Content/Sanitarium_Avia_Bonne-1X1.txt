Idea and developed by Avia Bonne 2018.

An imaginairy region created after the movie "One flew over the Cukoo's nest", but you will find many other insane characters when exploring this oarfile.

The meshpieces I used are all free downloaded from Yobi3D.com a free searchengine for free mesh.
I converted many pieces and edited them into other objects to create the region as how it is.
I used 3 freebie objects as well to decorate, so thanks goes to Shenn Tao, Night Raven and Arcadia Asylum for their work.

For those who love to examen insanity, enjoy!
