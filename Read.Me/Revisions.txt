REVISIONS FOR DREAMGRID
This is a high-level view of major changes. 

V4.64 Beta
Logging reports (Setup->Setting->Logging->{Analyze Logs] are styled better and report YEngine script errors now
Added a 1 second sleep after typed commands before potentially closing windows for readability

V4.63 Beta
Read and print Mysql Version that we are connected to.
Suppressed a possible crash in visitor counter. Something is fucky in Mysql connections to Robust.
Removed Robust restart when Smart start settings are changed.  

V4.62 Beta
Old Bug: Region re-normalize puts the selected region at 1000,1000 and moves the rest to match was just not working right at all. This is used by the original Javascript map. 
Fix glitches in Port renumbering. Reworked refresh button to re-fetch the ports from INI files.
Region Estates not always showing in Region list.
Setting Wifi Password prompted for password length too often and the Robust box did not close in some situations.

V4.61 Beta 
Added a Chat to Speech announcer to the Settings->Region. When enabled, this announces 
in a male or female voice arrivals and departures. It does not depend upon Concierge module which announces in-world in chat.

V4.6 General release
Could not restore from a .sql backup. A typo added a space in a file path.


V4.58
Lots of small tweaks to UI to improve performance.
Link set: Max number of prims increased to 1024.
Chat to Speech:  Added a Speech class for the future Chat to Speech system.  Will also be adding a translator. 
Bug:  Surrounding sims would start with nearby visitor when SS was disabled.
Bump connections to Mysql in my.ini for large grids like mine.
Added three more free OARS. - 2 adult and an older prim-based region.

V4.57  
Git is Rev V4 so it's `git checkout V4`.  My code is mostly written in Visual Basic and anyone can compile it for free.
Opensim is now same as core as of 7/31/2021. Rev is "#d0e41f747b9054 there should be no need..."
Many more translations to all 30 languages.
jOpensimProfiles.dll was not being deleted at startup, even if Joomla/jOpensim was off.  Is now deleted from the Zip, and is deleted by code if jOpenaim is off on startup. 
 This is necessary as Opensim stupidly loads all DLLs it finds - a big security issue to say the least!   have always removed any DLLs that a hacker could insert 
 as DreamGrid maintains its own curated list of allowed DLL's. But this one was allowed as it is needed for jOpensim. Catch-22, but its fixed in code so any slip-ups 
 like this will not happen again.
Estate name: not always showing in Region List. They will not show if MySQL is off, otherwise they will.
Smart Start:  Neighbor regions would not always start when an avatar was present in the center. This is a standard feature so you can walk to the next sim.  It follows the sim surround rules of 1,2, or 3 rings.
Events: seems to sometimes hang as its Http. And can take more time that should not be interfering with the main thread. Its been moved to a new thread.
Jopensim: Kickstart added back into the installer. Also a rev file added to show or suppress the you need to update screen.
Crash fix:  Windows caching could cause a crash when renaming a file during INI file checks.  The Crash report I added a while back has worked beautifully and thanks to the you folks, the reporters, 39 sneaky bugs have been fixed.
Changes to Diva settings causes robust to restart, if running, as it should.

V4.56
Search in Region list in non-English Languages blanked out all regions.  As "Search" <> "Suche". Fixed.
Cleanup and reorganize by running it through the CodeMaid extension
Opensim recompiled to not spam the bin region with Map-* maptiles which are just for debug.

V4.55
Important Fix for Default Hypergrid region - made it hard to visit a HG System!
Several potential crashes fixed in OpensimWorld and other places.

V4.54
Smart Boot Regions would shut down too soon. It poked their timer with a UUID instead of by name when an avatar was in it.
Setting a Region to Smart Boot would not take until Robust (or the grid) was restarted.  Robust will now restart if you set the SS switch.
AutoBackup view folder added, and also set the initial place for thew backups to Autobackup.

V4.53
You can Search just your grid if you run Apache.  You can also choose no Search, or DreamGrid's Hyperica search (DreamGrid-wide search, works without needing Apache). if Apache is enabled, you can use jOpensim search.

Allow 16-bit 64K global placement of regions again.  It was changed to 16K in Smart Start. Placement above 16K or 32K may lead to issues.

V4.52
New grid only - Initial startup timing issue in Process.PID could cause the Robust to not capture the grid owner name.
Deleting a region now deletes the regions map tiles.
Added a check so you cannot delete a running region. 
Multiple sims per dos box could cause a port clash.
De-registering regions with MySQL instead of typing for efficiency/less error prone.
System would not delete a region. Run time problem where an undefined RegionName was confused with a control by the same name.
Shutdown Timer for Smart Boot did not consider the boot time leading to a too early an exit on slow regions. 
Smart Boot regions that are next door to an Avatar will boot up so you can cross borders. 
Increased timeout from 10 to 60 seconds on Robust while waiting for process ID for slow PC's.
There was no help menu in Load IAR and Load OAR forms.
Help Once function was not working. This pops up Help when you first look at a control. It Just opened and closed.
The count of regions on the Diva home page did not include Smart Boot enabled regions.


V4.51 removed due to an isue with multipl sims per DOS box.

V4.5 
Possible crash if you delete a .bak file for Baretail. It's needed.
HelpOnce function was exiting immediately.
CHange default image for web pages.
Aborting the webserver thread could lead to a crash when debugging.

V4.46
Added start/stop/Delete Service controls to Mysql Icon.
Added Process Priority To Each Region. 
Added CPU affinity for each Region

V4.45
Map security was lacking.  Fixed in core Opensim.
Firestorm Beta fixes along with at least 100 more Opensim repairs by Ubit Umarov.

V4.44
Two more filters for regions: a Stopped and a Running filter
Two new free OARs. A dragon riding sim, and a Gateway to Africa, our Virunga sim.
Nooblets get the region list Pop Up.
Sped up detection of offline Robust to speed up shutdown by 59.5 seconds. 

V4.43
Reworked the port mapping to better handle adding or deleting regions while running. It detects safe shutdowns so it will reclaim/recycle ports from 8004 upward.
If running, it always adds a port to the end. Restarting will reuse the ports that are in the region files.
SmartStart: Added a settable number of seconds for regions to stabilize after boot before launching the teleport.   This lest you tune the length of time to let the region stabilize.
Running more than one grid on a server would improperly detect all running regions during shutdown and so would never shut down.
Explicit version message of VersionIS==> WillBe when prompted to update.  As in 4.3 ==> 4.4
Opensim world shows the avatars + NPCs, instead of the avatars. Oops.   The RPC call admin_get_agent_count command is  basically an antique.  I added a admin_get_avatar_count.


V.42 Internal alpha test

V4.41
Finally fixed the crash in some machines since 4.03.  Its timing in thread exits.
Crash report # 234345360: a crash could happen when restarting if two processes are using the PID file.
Expires files by age did not apply to all files in AutoBackup. 

V4.4  
Fixed a crash in Diva Panel when missing the Photo.
Prevent possible crash if no region is selected after starting to create one.
Use running Ports from INI if Opensim is running.
RegionList limited to one form.
RegionList Search box.
RegionList check boxes for All, Smart On, and Disabled
Save Size of the graphs
Add counts of Smart Boot to Region list title

V4.3-4.2 Alpha tests

V4.1 Performance Tweaks to Mysql and Smart Start
Fixed a crash in Diva web pages where a URL could (and did) crash robust.

V4.04 Performance Tweaks to Mysql and Smart Start

Partner Control Panel Is now Rev 4.1  now has a pretty look and works in both XEngine and YEngine.
This is a new Beta for Smart Start.  The Smart Start Button in "Settings" is now enabled.	
OpensimWorld Beacons now get pinged when in Smart Start Mode and a region is powered down.
The region count on the Diva Home Page adds in the number of ready-to-run Smart Start Regions.  
All teleport types, HG and local work with one exception: Login to an offline region
There is a new V4.1 Teleport Sign in Load Local IAR. This is just an ordinary sign, much like V2.5, except it does not check to see if a region is online.
	
Some Smart Boot features are missing:	
	You cannot log into a powered-off region.  Go to your Welcome region or Home, and set home to a region that is always on.
	Regions next to you should be powered on so you can walk or fly to them.  They do not. This works in Smart Surround.
	Run All Start buttons: An unregistered Smart Start Region will boot when you click Run All or Start. But a registered region is not be bootable from the GUI except by deregistering it or manually clicking it and selecting it from the Regions panel.

MySQL now supports running as a service. You should only enable this if your server is in a data center on a UPS with a generator backup, or if you have a UPS with a cord that shuts down the PC before the battery is dead.
Running as a service also relaxes the strict ACID settings in DreamGrid to allow buffering of writes to disk. 
Also increased the log size from 10MB to 100MB for performance which may make recovery from a crash take a bit longer.


V4.03
Added Arabic, Spanish (Spain), Persian, Brazilian and Portuguese languages and translated all Smart Start menus.
Smart Start button would not stick.
Welcome region has been missing a setting for Fallback region
Rare crash if the PID file was being read and written at the same time.
Force Viewers that are in range to update when a region is ready.
Region Builder knows how to set estate without typing.
Added a RPC enable login to force Opensim to accept teleports when it says its ready but is really only mostly ready.

V4.02 5-23-2021 Fixes to Smart Start, signs, and some UI performance improvements 
Thankxx to Richard Dennis, who reported that adding a Region from the Setup->Settings->Region-[Add] button would always create an extra "New Region".  
Robust could start and would lie about being ready and this could cause a crash when a region boots too early when the database was still being generated.
Opensim would still jab the API in some cases even if global SS was disabled. 
API now requires the Machine ID as a password.
SS created regions have the Teleport sign bit enabled.
Large grids develop a long and longer "stutter" when starting up due to some expensive tasks that ran every 5 seconds. The system would fall further and further behind, which required interlock code to prevent recursion. Moved two subs to their own low priority threads which speeds up other critical tasks such as teleports shutdowns and bootups by 5X to 20X or more.  
	CPUCalc() gathers the CPU percentages to display only when the Region list is displayed. It's not time critical. This was a massive CPU time killer when I run hundreds of regions - even on a fast machine it delayed things by 30 seconds or more when 180 regions are running .  
	DidItDie() scans for exiting processes. It has to do an expensive system call on all regions over and over. It's not time critical and can take its time as a separate thread.
By default, OpenSimulator does not allow scripts to make HTTP calls to addresses on the simulator's LAN. This is for your LAN's security and your safety. An adjustment to this in 4.01 prevented some teleport signs from working. 
Added more "allows" to the list of LSL destinations. These are the only LAN Addresses that scripts can reach.

	localhost:DiagnosticPort	http://(loopback via DNS)(8001)   
	127.0.0.1:DiagnosticPort	http://(loopback IP)(8001)
	LANIP.DiagnosticPort		http://(PC LAN IP):(8001)
	LANIP:HttpPort				http://(PC LAN IP):(80)
	PublicIP:HttpPort			http://(PC WAN IP or DNS Name):(80) in case a loopback adapter is involved

V4.01 Maintenance
Just some tweaks, no need to update unless you are a Smart Start Alpha tester.
Slower machines on first install may miss the Create User dialog. Added a Information MNsgBox in all 30 languages to wait for Robust to finish updating.
Smart Start has several fixes:
	A sign V4.0 is in the Local IAR folder.   This suppresses an error and supports
	ESTATE, NAME and GROUP sorting. It also works on 127.0.0.1:8001.
	All you need to do is add the password,
	The "Welcome to Smart Start" Free OAR has the new signs in it.
	The Help-Debug section has a test setup to teleport any avatar to any region.
	Added a Mysql check of the region status (0x4=online) before initiating a teleport.
Added a Mysql Console menu in the main form under the Mysql Menu.

V4.0 Release
This update will notify you its time to update.
Added sortable columns for User Age in days, Birth date, count of inventory items, and User level to User Screen

V.392
Map Render Max Height could be set to some numbers. 
X translated as Y, doh!
Enable script function lsSetWindlightScene so scripted EEP should work. This script function is restricted to the region owner only.
Added a Force Update to Help Menu so you can get updates on demand instead of waiting for a release.
All manuals updated, including the big PDF.


V3.931
Icecast did not redirect to the /status.xsl home page. An <Alias=..> got wildcarded in, should be <alias= ..>
Icecast updated to latest 2.4.4

V3.93
If you click the Run Backups Now button, all Running region OARS will be saved right then. Previously, all OARS were only saved by Opensim after so many hours of run time.
Wifi-Custom Web pages make themselves from White theme on first click.
Fixed rare crash in WindowHandler.
Updated Manuals from Diva to License in alphabetical order.  

V3.929
Fixes an issue where you could only make 1X1 regions.
If you tried to teleport into a Smart Boot-enabled region, it shut down as soon as it booted.

V3.928
Right click and editing a running region would lead to an instant crash.  Thankxx to a tip from Luna Dreamweaver.
The fix for this also fixes an issue where the region could not be started if the Set Window Title function did not work. And this is a very unreliable function.
Also a less error prone method for detecting how many regions are still running when quitting the system.
MAC address 469947894f9e298a7726b4a58ff7bf9f cannot be banned.  This is a Windows Loopback Adapter. A note is appended if you try it.


V3.927
False start on V3.926: The OpensimWorld Beacon did not post the region Name - Fixed
It also always deleted scripts on startup due to an extra space. - Fixed

V3.926 
Git is on V3 branch now.
Reworked the Region Editor to have better help, tabs and manuals.
OpensimWorld Beacon API Key can be put in the Region Settings. Makes it easy for me to add to all my regions, and still give them away without spreading my keys around.
Both type of signs work in Smart Start cases
Add x 1X1, 2X2, or 3X3 sim surround to Smart Start.
Reset Tab order on all forms.
Trees work a little better. Set the rez height to average of min/max. There is no grass, as no one knows the viewer parameters. 
Load OAR and other commands will start a Paused region and then load it
Opensim has more debug settings enabled. Slight performance decrease in exchange for better crash reporting to me.
Redirected avatars get admin notices of what is going on.
Log analyzer works even if Opensim is running.
MAC address analysis added to Log Analyzer

V3.924
New Feature: Log file parser added for Opensim.ini and Robust.log with hop links to the defective script/prim.
Smart start is Alpha code - please do not enable it unless its on a new, blank grid.
Remote Admin commands needed to start and stop regions added to Metropolis, OsGrid and Region servers
Smart Start has choice for Estate Owner for [SimSurround] Landfill function. Landfill creates a water or land region surrounding any region with a person in it.
More crashes detected by users, thank you for sending in the reports!: Icecast log folder may not have been created due to a missing .keep, This causes a crash when a log sweep occurs. 
Region panel may open in detailed mode before mysql has started.
Dogwood trees were missing from the Tree and Plant Selection, so it always tried to plant it as the default was True. Dogwood default is now off, and we also know that Dogwood is both a tree and a flower and is the state flower of Virginia. 
The land filler would incorrectly fill in non-1X1 region.  If a pre-existing 4X4 was located, it would only see the lower left, and the 15 remaining slots would collide.

V3.923
Apache could be missing a default folder in OutworldzFiles\Logs\Apache due to a missing .keep, which I use to force git to keep the empty folder.
A crash could occur when avatars appear as Hypergrid and local visitors.

V3.922
Log File parser to list all avatars and to detect errors in Opensim.log
Log files get cleared out on schedule as set by "Keep For Days" in the Autobackup settings. The change is you can disable this so log files persist
New grids get a default of 1 day instead of 7 to Autobackup.
Setting->logs has a view logs button and an Analyze button. It does only one thing at the moment. It makes a Excel-compatible CSV list of all avatars that have logged in since the logs were cleared. 
Plans are to have it make a list of bad prims and other things that you can clean up.
Concierge defaults to Off.
Auto Filling of empty lands allows up to 3 region-wide sim surround
About 1,000 names randomly chosen for new regions.  You can make your own list in Outworldzfiles.
Added photos of all Trees and Bushes.
Autofill regions are placed in Estate 1999 "SimSurround"
Various changes to AI generated lands, and add settings for smooth, bump and land level to GUI
Known issue: Smart Start will shut down the surrounding sims - it should keep them running.
Known issue: Regular teleport do not interface to Smart Boot regions. No scripted teleports to SS_enabled lands. Hypergrid links work, as do the V3.9 signs.


V3.921
**** Do Not enable Smart start on your grid. If you want to play with it, use it on a new, blank grid.
**** It will break all teleport except Landmarks and HG Visitors. 
Missing default images for your Diva web page.
Missing 10,000 names in a file, breaking Autofill regions.
Missing Apache's magic file and a dozen readme's
I hate 7Zip, replaced with Perl

V3.92
Physics default was always overridden to off in Region options.


V3.91 Post fixes for 3.9

Scrolling Text box bottom was not floating with the bottom of the window.
Teleport signs got back a UUID instead of a region name, so scripted teleports were borked. missing an else.

V3.9 
Change the Load OAR options to be more visible. These remember the last setting.

V3.8996
Zip 64 functions are enabled now, should stop all the Backup crashes. Whodathunk thats not on by default? Not me!
If disk < 50 MB free, suspend all running regions. Mysql and robust are left running to flush to disk. When disk space is available, thaw the regions.
Now 29,950 Translation. in the spreadsheet.  Edits should me emailed to fred@outworldz.com so they can be compiled in, thank you very much! This uses a new mechanism thats much easier to merge and make them
Now Showing prim counts! in Region Details.
Teleport Sign shows all Smart Boot Regions + running regions. Signs just show running region if Smart Boot is off.
Halved setup time by setting INI files just once unless you changed something.
Record and use boot time for map on and off separately.
Restart All Button starts all Smart Boot regions.
Load OAR, View Console, Start buttons will bring up a Smart Boot region.
Parcels in OARs are loaded by default.
Check if sims overlap and issue a warning of which overlap, and where.
Added buttons in Load OAR as no everyone is blind to the Options.
Git failed to save important DLLs so WhoGotWhat failed on every development machine.Thank you, core. Not every DLL can be compiled as you don't include libOpenMetaverse and many others such as Log4Net.
7Zip will not add a file named 'magic'. Or any file without a file extension.  Not no way, not no how. 

V3.8995
Add a debug entries screen to toggle internal stuff on and off
Added a disk space calculator and warning is disk space is low.
View all maps did not tile as expected.

V3.8994
Delete the tmp folder in case backups crash
Diagnostics port 8001 never moved - was always on 8001
Better timing of pause between sims when starting one at a time.
Region Servers used the wrong IP

V3.8993
Multiple tests of the LoadAllOArs function now pass.
Show Disk free space and warn if disk space gets low.
More Icons everywhere.
Backup just the region INI, not all the other rebuilt  stuff in Regions.
Added a Teleport log


V3.8992
Smart Start Alpha code improved to accept HG visitors - if the region they want is not online, they get routed to The Welcome region.

V3.8991
Smart Start 1.0 Alpha release. Documentation coming later. Deal with it.
Added a backup of the Statistics database, where logins and such are stored.
Switched to Co-op mode for scripts which is more stable. Helps with stuck shutdowns.
Added Start/Stop and Delete buttons for Apache. Do not stop apache, un-install it, install it, and start it. Just start it, okay?
Region Icons line up in columns, and the Avatars and Users columns remember size changes.
Added Show All Maps button to Maps
Add DefaultRegion to all regions that are not Smart Start. Both HG and Local visitors will get redirected if the Welcome (HG default) region is offline.

V3.899
Changes to the way signs work for Smart Start. 
Splash page could be entered without a http, which breaks the splash page and gives a cryptic error.
Fix in restore SQL database  - just click the .sql and restore it.
Tmp folder could fill up in V3.98 and fill a hard drive. Now gets emptied on startup.

V3.898
Add path to robocopy as Windows Server can't seem to find it.
MysqlDump timeout  with --compress and  --skip-lock-tables --compress --quick.  Lets us back up while running without killing the Sims.
Add 10 more language translations - 30 Languages now!
Fix crash if no name when loading an OAR.
Re-enable all Physics engines.
Valid UUIDs with Guid.TryParse.

V3.897
Firewall may not be properly set due to a race condition in V3.896. Depends upon CPU speed, disk and region count
Firewall script now runs as a parameterized thread with unique file name, fw.bat no longer used
Small improvement in speed in Region List for estate queries.
MySQLdump (.sql) backup speedup and better transactional stability option.
Add a Fix_presence.bat file in case an  avatar gets stuck.

V3.896
More changes so you can save a region while running.
Added Concierge module which announces people coming and going in each region. Enable it globally in Setup-Settings->Regions and restart the region.  Selectable on/off per region. 
Latest FSassets file backup would not work if paths had spaces in them.

V3.895
jOpensim fixes for profiles and many other settings.  Many thanks to Rich Dennis for his help and good ideas.
PHP has OpenSSL enabled so jOpensim can send emails via PHP.
Modern viewers will bypass the Region bottleneck and get textures directly from the Robust service.
FSAssets: Backups of FSassets are no longer compressed into a zip instead there is a Mirrored copy to Autobackup/FSAssets.  This makes it more efficient to backup files over a network as only files that have changed need to be copied or moved.
FSAssets: Backups can be done over a \\shared name, and it will wait for the share to be initialized.
FSAssets:If destination free disk space is < 50 MB, the backup of FSAssets will stop.
FSAssets:It should run very quickly after the first run as it only copies assets with the A bit set, then it resets it. The A bit is set if a file is created or modified.
Much faster way to get the PID of running processes which speeds up booting.

V3.894
Send emails to any or all local users

V3.893
Glitch in Save IAR

V3.892
Maps have a print preview and print button.
Loading or saving IARS has auto complete for avatar name.
Once again fixed the Add Region while running logic.

V3.891
IARs required a password again due to update of Opensim. This sets it back to no password.

V3.89
Backups run on Calendar time now, not on runtime.  So if set for daily, and you shut down for a day it will make a backup when you start it. Previous versions required the sim to run for a day or longer before a backup occurred.
Backups run in a single thread, sequentially to keep from overwhelming slow CPU's
Error Logger now reports the stack contents and line number where the error was logged. 
Possible crash fix in Web page settings if an image had been deleted manually.
Problem in Group Settings for IM "MessageOnlineOnlyUsers=true"
Add XYSettings.ini to backups
Added a formal Copyright screen with links to the AGPL 3.0 copyright

V3.88
Minor problem in printing every hour

V3.87 
OsGrid boots once again. Had to change some of the files to match the latest version.
Physics Hybrid selection in a Region could be set but did not show as selected when re-edited.
Added a Perl example that can go through a folder of large numbers of OARs and keep just 1 per month, moving the extras to a different folder. Requires Strawberry Perl.
The INI files have been reorganized into a folder for each type of server - Robust Grid, Region Addon, OsGrid and Metropolis in the Config-include/Proto folder for easier editing.
Backups of Settings and Photos added to zips.
Splash screen photos got stepped on in an update. This is the last update that will do so. They are also backed up in the zip file.
Use Hashed MAC address of PC for DNS security. Log4Net has a security issue that a review shows does not affect Opensim.
Don't bitch about Welcome region on region servers.
Backup folder if missing, would cause a complaint loop and possible crash. 
Handle NAT and non-NAT routers situations gracefully. 
"Go.bat Some DOS Box Name" now handles DOS boxes with spaces in their names.
Log files moved to Outworldzfiles\Logs.
The countdown timer of regions that are still running shows only changes.
CPU use set to zero if region is shut off or suspended.
Saving of INI files should be more reliable, with retry logic.
Saving of new region or renaming could cause the region to become blank or not start.

V3.86 
Cuteulala Artis spotted that OARS were saving in the wrong folder due to a missing slash. Thanks for the tip!
A pop up could occur when closing out a grid telling you it cannot deregister regions.

V3.85 
Backups chat how many are running and a message when they are finished.
Themes would not save the image to the running theme, just to the next running theme.
Windows on Top control moved to a Menu and added to the main form
Large fonts and High DPI screens would cause icon sizes to change and the Graphs to not fit
Changed many icons to just blue
One of two ways to make a sign showed all regions, instead of just online regions
Adding a region or deleting one could cause the Region HTTP Port (Group Port) to collide with another region.
Brought back all Physics Engines.
Added Ninja (Ragdoll) prim physics enable for ODE.


V3.84 Post fixes
Another crash in Black and White Diva Wifi Image on boot.
Systems running with a merged database where robust and region files are in the same db would backup twice.
Ban Lists did not reload automatically. It required you to click the Ban list after a reboot.


V3.83 Post Fixes
GUI Crash may be happening when running backup tasks. Added code to help spot the issue.
Added SQL backup to the backup scheduler. Caution ! FSAssets and SQL backups will fill up a disk quickly. Most useful if you want all  backups with one click, or have lots of disk space and a small number of days to keep.
Graphs now float to fill the screen correctly.
MySqlBackup could not be turned off.


V3.82 Post fixes
Backup of SQL files did not work.  Zip was never made
Added a crash logger for all unhandled exceptions. It pops up a request to send the error securely to me.
Icons for Robust, Mysql, etc did not change color on a crash.
Add longer timeout to manual for FSassets help, and the Opensimulator wiki.

V3.81 Post-fixes
Adding a new Region no longer requires restarting the grid
Backups used to make a copy, then zipped the copies folder. This used 1.5 times the original data while being backed up.  Now it uses about half, depending on compression, throughout the entire process. Thanks for the idea, Marianna!
Apache sometimes would not install. Added an isApacheInstalled function to detect and install. Thanks for the tip, Garrt Beaumont!
Mysql could not restore or backup some very large assets > 100 MB.
System no longer types in console, except for Robust
Deleted Regions de-register from robust so you can place a new region there
Added a Region Message button to Region Pop Up so you can send Blue alerts more easily.  
Shutting down while zipping up backups would create large tmp files. These took a long time at startup to delete.

V3.8 Release

V3.799
XMLRPC is deprecated.
MaxPort prevented you from adding a region and restarting it.  Now adds Region port to the end of the list
Save IAR does no longer ask for passwords.
Server 2019 C++ Service Pack added.

V3.798
Opensim is latest build #70e00a00ec ("fix creators user cache", 2021-01-07)
 

V3.797
Backup improvements in file handling by using a tmp folder

V3.796
Backup improvements
Log file improvements
Some intermittent false crash alarms due to code order
CPUCounter disabled for now - causing speed issues on slower machines.

V3.795
Intermittent crash popup at startup fixed.

Added a topmost setting for The Region list to keep it on top of everything
Sorting of Region List both directions by clicking the header.
Format RAM in Region List as Mib = 1024 bytes, reduce CPU usage and fix an inconsistency in Groups with more than one region in memory use.
Wart user if try to quit while a backup is still running. Also prints that the backup has finished.
Updater can be updated
Apache logs expire with the "Keep For Days" setting
Threw out three years of work on Restart logic and rebuilt it all using XMLRPC and detecting process Window names. 



V3.794
Auto Restart now handles region restarts if the GUI has been restarted. Users can reliably restart a region.
Speedup: Only as many Performance counters as necessary, for umm, performance!
Boot Speedup: Install Apache only if it has changed folder. Also stops Apache from occasionally not starting. 
Opensim error: Mutelist and SearchURL fixes if Jopensim was enabled and them disabled.

V3.793
Error starting Icecast due to a missing slash.

V3.792
Prior version mixed up a INI file and never re-wrote the Opensim.ini.
Depending upon your situation, it would  boot but not let you log in. Or crash regions and not boot.


V3.791
Grid Gloebits broke in 3.79 when region Gloebit was fixed for jOpensim
Possible crash fixed when shutting down.
Log levels are sticky again. As one example If you set it to INFO, it will be INFO on a reboot. Log Folders were broken by changes to Log4Net in core.
Groups on Region servers were set to the wrong port.
XMLRPC and Remote Admin ports default to off = 0
Allow backups to non std config folders.
MySQL tweaks to 50 MB logs and larger buffer for imports of large mesh items.


V3.782 
Autobackups now support periodic backups of Regions, Mysql, and Settings.ioni into zip files. 
This function used to just do OARs. Now any running region makes oars and DreamGrid backs up Settings.ini, region .ini files,  and a copy of the entire database, then zips them. If you have fsassets enabled, you can back it up and compress it too.  Each setting can be enabled and disabled.  The system deletes every file older than the number of days you set.   These are the same settings you are familiar with in Backups, just set to very low.
 
When you load this rev, if Joomla is installed, this will prompt for an update if one is available. There is a easy way to update jOpensim included in Setup->Settings->Joomla/jOpensim. Your content will not be overwritten.

Maps, local Search, Users and Groups all work.  jMoney does not yet work (it crashes, so the DLL is disabled).

Joomla is now 3.9.23, jOpensim is 0.3.2.0. The jOpensim webpage is now at V5 which has web page instructions on how to edit after an install. 

MySqlRev = "5.6.5" to prep for Joomla V4, which requires at least 5.6, 5.65 is the next release.5.7 requires major changes, we may never see that.

Gloebit runs in Grid mode on Grids, in Region mode on region servers. No need to open Port 3306 and protect it with firewall on Region servers to get Gloebit.

Major changes in how translations work to make it easier to maintain. About 16,000 of them now. If you have both English and other language skills, please take a look at the Spreadsheet in Outworldzfiles and help us translate more phrases.

Help Files are now web pages for ease of maintenance. The RTF files are still the source for these in github Src, but are not in releases as they are huge.

Added Remote Admin port to all regions for future use and for jOpensim.

Enable AddinExample to capture simple script input.

Enable WhoGotWhat to capture in world events.

BanList changes for IP addresses which now support /24 subnets


V3.781 JOpensim  Update
This rev of DreamGrid supports Rev 0.3.2.0.  If you are running Jopensim at an earlier rev, you must update JOpensim in the Joomla/administrator menu. There are minor changes in new added features, but huge changes to the internal communication structure between OpenSimulator and Joomla.

Step 1) To Update Joomla, navigate to your Joomla admin panel at http://127.0.0.1/JOpensim/administrator and log in as Admin.  In the top menu, go to Component->Joomla Update and update your Joomla system.  
Step 2)Go to Extensions-Manage->Install and click Browse to File.   The file you install is in OutworldzFiles\Apache\JOpensim_Files\Version0.3.2.0. Select and install pkg_jopensim.0.3.2.0.zip. There is no need to unzip it first.


V3.78 JOpensim fix
A password was accidentally put in the JOpensim Backup.  Fix has been back ported to V3.77.
Minor fix to ban list to prevent a blank line from creeping in.
Hyperica.com rewritten to get rid of ancient PHP5 code with many improvements for Search. Only V3.77 and higher are supported.
Load Local IAR crashed system - leftover old code

Known issues: JOpensim search is still down. 

To Do list:

⬜ A lot of buttons should be grayed in Region Servers as they deal with robust.
⬜ Group notice has no image
⬜ In LAN mode, warn and turn off publicity as you cannot be reached ★
⬜ Autobackup folder is wrong for SQL backup batch file
⬜ Empty the assets table in MySQL when FSassets is in use ★
⬜ Avatar can be in region at startup?
⬜ Check that selecting a name causes the name to be claimed in the Names table ★
⬜ Everyone wants to change the image ★
⬜ Rework http://outworldz.com/Outworldz_installer/Welcome.htm ★
⬜ Add warning of Apache log sizes and a way to delete them ★
⬜ Add FSsassets and auto run the fsassets import command when the switch is first flipped.
⬜ Add set root password for mysql option
⬜ Add search in Regions List
⬜ Add date/time switch to console logging
⬜ Add enabled for each Database for service replacement We do not want to stop a MYsql is installed as a service.
⬜ ADD PARAMS FOR Restart time and CPU %
⬜ Allow editing of UUID when region is not running. If it changes, update the UUID in the dictionary.
⬜ Script for Partners only works in XEngine
⬜ Add Classifieds in Viewer.  The viewer can read them, just no way to add them yet.




V3.77
Data snapshot (Search) was interfering with Diva Wifi. The Wifi module has been removed from Regions and is now in Robust onl. The side effect is if you wish to test if a region is running with a web browser, you use the Statistics button in Regions Panel.
Offline IMs now work again. Needed to use the Public URL and Public port, not private port 8003. 
Group IM’s now work. Same thing. 
Clicking Start now redoes all INIs. A bit slower to boot, but less confusing as you should no longer have to exit the app for some changes to take effect.
Joomla MAPs & Apache needed PHP7 curl, which would not load. They could have just read the files off disk, but noooo. It’s been “fixed” by copying necessary (and very old) DLLs to Windows/System32. These are OpenSSL V1.02. No idea what PHP people are going to do in the future as these DLLS are really, really dead, but also really necessary. A test file is located at Http://Grid:80/curl_test.php and it should print your Public IP address.
RemoteAdmin Port has been altered for use with Joomla. See Ports setup.
XMLRPC Ports can be set per region. Some third party apps use them for money.
Local IAR HypeEvents IAR changed to have a clickable link to the current Hypevents provider.
The DreamGrid Test Region in the free OARS has been modified with an updated radio, HypeEvents and other free goodies.
A new translation.vb added to eliminate all the constant editing of non-editable files.
Reset Password link in Viewer was broken
Log level change now survives reboots.
IAR and OAR menus reorganized to be easier to locate the various ways to load and save things.
Built and tested a shared region module “WhoGotWhat”. It uses use a LSL script in a ‘giver’ box. Touching the box gives the contents. It also posts Who, What, Where the contents was given, and logs when it happens in Outworldzfile\Opensim\Bin\ WhoGotWhat.csv. Should work in Region Servers, too. The grid owner can load this into a spreadsheet and know what people have been getting. 



V3.76
Add remote Admin port and XMLRPC ports to firewall and UPNP
PHP7 curl works now for Jopensim to use
Patch around an issue with Hyperica.com's SSL interfering with Opensims inability to fetch from a https source


V3.75 Updater Tweak 
Removed deprecated Ionic.zip.dll. Older versions of DreamGrid were forced to use this DLL at an even old rev due to collisions in updater and older Dreamgrids. Now its really, really dead. Replaced by System.Compression.DotNetZip.
DreamGridUpdater case in URL (Dremgrid vs DreamGrid) caused download to be incredibly slow. An updateable redirect at Outworldz.com was supposed to send this URL to a Cloud Storage service. It did not always do so.
Add CAA record to Outworldz and Hyperica DNS for security - prevents forgery of certificates.

V3.74 Updater Updated
Run “DreamGridUpdater.exe”. It will shut off Apache and MySQL, download the latest released and extract it, then click Start.exe for you. 
Some region columns could end up with 0 width and so they disappeared. 
Added more checks for correct data entry to regions such as Script timer and Frame timers. Limits added: .05 < value > 1.
JOpensim’s RemoteAdminPort was 5050 in all regions which crashed the 2nd region onward. It is now a variable set to 0, happens on only one region as originally intended, and the port is disabled by default. Crash fix was also pushed back into 3.73.
Simplified JOpensim Installer can choose between JOpensimSearch of your local grid or Hyperica Global Search.

V3.73 is a small improvement in Joomla/Jopensim
Tweaks to Joomla Install Button.
Joomla Search enabled. This actually sucks, will add a button to toggle between it and Hyperica search which works.
Same for JMoney. It’s a pay-for-license thing.
Scrolling text accidentally moved – fixed.
Suppress SSL msg in PHP in event manager.
Sitemap.xml now auto updates for all 4 CMS systems.
Allow remote admin in Joomla.

V3.72
Apache update to 2.4.41
PHP updated to version 7.4.12
Apache now supports streaming video for mp4 files so you can use modern players and seek quickly.
Simplified Joomla install to one zip file.
Maps work in JOpensim (curl is fixed)

V3.71
The 25,000 pickable DNS names updated to be more random when clicking Next.
Added Alias field to HG DNS Name Setting so you can run more than one URL to your grid. For example, both www.outworldz.com and outworldz.com. Or an old grid name. The alias field accepts a comma delimited list of names.
Gloebits is fixed again.
JOpensim constants added for Search and Profiles.
JOpensim constants added for Search and Profiles.
Drop ODE, Bullet/Hybrid modes. We now have UBODE and Bullet in a separate thread.
Update Opensim to #ba46b5bf8bd0 libomv master 0.9.2.dev 2020-09-21 2020-10-14 19:44.
Fixed German Translations which causes boxes to change size.
New grids regions start within +/- 10 of the 1000,1000 start point for the main map to use.

V3.7
Sendkeys had issues so sometimes save all oars not working. Set to consistent behavior in Start.exe.config
Threaded System backup to not block the main UI
Added Joomla DLL's to bin

V3.695 Alpha Release for 3.7
Minor tweaks

V3.694 Alpha Release for 3.7
Another bug in Banlist fixed, could not add more than one http:grid.com>:8002 address

V3.693 Alpha Release for 3.7
Fixes to Ban Lists for Viewer name. This uses a simple string compare.
One can use a Substring of the viewer name to disable only certain versions
 Example: Agent uses the viewer "Imprudence 1.3.2.0"
 - "Imprudence" has no access
 - "Imprudence 1.3" has no access
 - "Imprudence 1.3.1" has access as the string does not match
For the old Darkstorm copybot viewer, use “Firestorm-Releasex64 5.0.11” or “Firestorm-Releasex64 5" to ban all older Firestorms.

V3.692 Alpha Release for 3.7
Recompiled Opensim

V3.691 Alpha Release for 3.7
Fixes to Ban Lists for Grid name, use syntax like http://hg.osgrid.org:80
Moved Banlist.txt into Settings.ini for portability
Add a visitor list to the Local IAR that is styled like the Teleport sign

Known Issues:
Dot Net 4.8 does not compile for me. Stull at 4.6.
Viewer bans are too banny. Seems to be an Opensim bug.
You cannot run more than 1 grid on an IP without using Domain names. http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=8771 
Arabic and Farsi translations do not work at all so they are disabled.

Drop PDB files to save zip file size.
Another try at fixing the missing texture popup in EEP Firestorm
Added updated parts to the Test Island:
Fixed Shaun's Radio, as it did not run in the latest Opensim. There are prims on colored tiles outlining separate parcels to test the Search Parcel features of different prims in your viewer at Hyperica.com. Tides test: there is a ruler for showing the tides going up and down 3 meters in 15 minutes and also the test buoy. I have this script in water lilies and surf in my sims. Both teleporters and the Partners prim are there for testing. And Opensim Birds are available.

V3.63 Post Fixes
Opensim updated to #e9b4bca0899f13eab 0.9.2.dev 2020-08-25.

YEngine script is now the default for new DreamGrids.


V3.58 Post Fixes 7/14/2020
When more than one grid is run on a PC do not shut off wrong Robust.
Region Form remembers the column widths in Details mode.
OsGrid complained about 2 economy modules.
Viewers complained that items are not available even when suitcase is off. This is a visual reminder to local users that their inventories are unavailable while they are traveling, and available when they return. Now should warn only if you enable suitcase, and off if you disable the suitcase. 
OsGrid alias added to match the latest OsGrid specs.
Map button disabled except when this is a grid.
Adding a region did not add a hole in the firewall.
PHP warns in Apache log now suppressed.

His alert sound patch adds the alert sound that Firestorm uses to signify radar alerts and keyword alerts.
Added XMLRPC port to each Region for third party tools to control Opensim. 
http://opensimulator.org/wiki/RemoteAdmin:RemoteAdmin_Examples

7-1041
V3.56 Post Fixes 6/18/2020
New Feature: Updates could destroy added on services such as WordPress or Joomla. Added a switch to 
Apache to select "DreamGrid Diva", WordPress, or Joomla/JOpensim or "Other" folder as the home page, 
such as http://(your grid):80, aka http://(your grid). Documentation on this is not in this update. 
But to put it simply, there are three new folders in Apache/htdocs. Unzip Joomla or WordPress in the folder.
Change the Setting in Apache, click the Apache icon and select Restart. The rest is just setting up your CMS.
Improvement: Change priority of webserver to realtime to help icons stay in sync on super busy servers.
Tweak: Re-write Icecast XML on Start, not just boot.
Crash prevention: If blank "Server Admin" email, use "not@set.yet" to allow Apache to start anyway. 
Performance: Don't scan logs if Restart on physics Crash is set for anything but Bullet in a separate thread, as it useless.

Icons have Help option for each background service.

V3.47 Release Candidate for 4.5 4/26/2020
The IAR save only saved the Wifi Admin IAR. Reverted back to standard Opensim so you need to know or reset the users password. Doh!

V3.46 Release 4/26/2020
Opensim checks passwords for IARS now, but you only use Wifi Admin’s password. Makes it much easier to dump an IAR for a customer/user and makes it more secure. Users can load IARS in the Wifi Web Panel using their password.

V3.45 Release 4/21/2020
Change Offline IM Group port to port 8003 to stop endlessly repeating error messages in Robust.
Allow empty bin\Libraries.proto for one person who wants no library.
Simplified Try catch to catch all exceptions everywhere.

Missing line of code broke Gloebits if any settings were not the default.
Home page links fixed in viewer for login and Help

TOS form would save, but not stick around after an update or a change from black to white or custom.
Always set Gloebits INI as region servers will crash without it set up.
Wrong folder for cache. Oops.
Just hide the damn downloader.

V3.41 Post fixes release 3/6/2020
A load OAR or Load IAR search and clicking to load it got you the wrong item. Thankxx for the tip, Scott Taylor!

V3.4 release 2/28/2080
Fixed issues in German Translation that caused a crash for Dieter Mueller. Thank you very much for the valuable feedback.
About 100 of the translations were not 'taking'.
New form for Nooblets to use to create the initial avatar. Thanks to Garry Beaumont for pushing for this.
Avatar View in Region list was not set to visible. Oops
Spellcheck every manual - Office 365 Word has no grammer (sic) or other errors, and it shows readability from 6th to 9th grade so there is no excuse for not reading them. 
Publicity module crash when nothing was entered. There was a string set to nothing. Should have been "", which is not nothing.



V3.38 Beta
Extensive refactoring and state machine changed in region restart. 
Main form resizes in all screen scale font size.
Updated 15460 translations, including hand-updated German and French. Thank you very much to all the volunteers!
Should be able to change most settings and restart the region without shutting down the grid.
Sped up lots of places and much more threading during boot and shutdown. 

V3.37 Beta
Updates started at 0, should be at curtrent version to prevent repetitive begging for updates.
Robust double start fixes.
DNS shows busy when testing.
Allow changes to Opensim.ini, Gloebits and birds to take effect without resetting the entire system, usually through changing a region settings.
Max region port function would not always return the highest port, preventing multiple DOS boxes from booting w/o restarting the system

V3.36 beta
Possible hard crash in Check for Update if going from from V3.34 to V3.35. A variable was FALSE, should have been a number

V3.35 Beta
Added Search to Load OAR and Load IAR (web)
Stopped a crash on Server 2016 if Publicity was blank.
Several Updater and Downloader changes so updates can be skipped. Updates are automatically downloaded to a zip file in the root folder. The next startup or Help->Check For Updates, it detects the fresh zip and asks if you want to update to that version. If yes, it brings up the Backup screen, then shuts down mysql and Apache, and launches an unzipper.  if you chose No, it will not prompt you again until the next version is ready.

V3.34 Beta
When region is not running, speed up region click from 15 seconds to 1 second by using an async TCPCLient to probe the port.
Reset CPU usage to 90% instead of 75% for slow machines
Crash on Server 2016 when SetMyINI value is nothing.

V.33 Beta 
Can always hide region DOS boxes,always show, or hide when done with an action.
God Mode fixes where region overrides could get stuck on or off
Disable Residents fixes where region overrides could get stuck on or off
Lots of tweaks to region restart.
Made it so the chooser and other important dialogs pop to the front. It was not really possible to edit two regions, before this. 
Can now add multiple regions at the same time without breakage.
A Diagnostics log to show the details.
Added uncaught exception error handler/logger. See Error.log if it just quits.
Use HTTP with redirects at server in case SSL fails.
A new "Pausing" icon/state when Region Recycling is used. Restarts will be about 30 seconds now as there are two stages
Allow_osMessageObject and Allow_osGetNotecard set true for Satyr farming by non estate managers.
Updates to Nuget repos.
Updated Apache to latest version 2.4.1 so it can handle TLS1.3.
Generate graphic titles to all web-downloadable IAR and OARs. 
Reworked Cache on main server to load much faster. My server's SSD needs upgrading due to all the 3D crap you peeps get for free. Its 385 GB used out of 400. Eeep!
SSL added to Hyperica.com content. What a pain. Should be "Future-proof" for both SSL and non-SSL versions of Hyperica.com and Outworldz.com by not using SSL at all except thru server-side redirects.
Checked every possible web access, and no it does not break your grid if Hyperica or Outworldz.com is down. Grid-wide Search and load OAR and IAR will obviously be offline. Deal with it.
Closing the settings form now closes all the child settings forms for garbage collection.
15X15-sized region was not selectable, and the settings defaulted to max of 4 if you looked again after a save.
Tests DNS name when saved.

V3.32 Beta 

Clicking the Clear cache button could cause a crash if the fsasset folder did not exist.


V3.31 Beta

A major change in internal structure should speed up the region list and boot to be significantly faster. This also improves responsiveness due to fewer blocking loops.

New grids will get a set of regions at a random starting address. This greatly reduces the problem of teleport fails when hypergridding between grids where the regions are at the same X and Y location. You can't.

Both the Metropolis map and the Google map use automagic to center the welcome region on the map.

Avatar counts now match between the region list and the main form. It used to leave the last avatar count on the main form.

If you hover on the Main form where it says N Avatars, you get a list of avatars and the region.

Clicking an avatar name in the region list brings up a teleport to the avatar. This works best if the Viewer you are using was the last viewer you installed.

Concierge announces the avatar Login/Logout in the DreamGrid console.

Double start of Robust should be gone now. It was recursion and timing related.

Opensimulator now uses UseCSJ2K for maps. This should reduce the number of warnings when making higher resolution maps.

MAXprims has been tweaked when you set a override.

The updater has been tweaked to be significantly faster. It runs in background and leaves a zip file of the proper revision in the root folder.

Icecast did not get updated on Startup, but only when you saved the form. Moving the system to a new folder thus broke Icecast.

Maps uses UseCSJ2K for fewer warnings.

This version has a new var region preview map button. There is a button in Help where you select the region, and a button in the Popo up form when you click a region in the Region List.

Clicking a region name in the Regions form no longer brings up the DOS Box. There is a View Console button in the popup.

Changing the enable flag in Regions did not prompt "save?", if you just closed the region box.

Cache clear happens much faster. Except for scripts. Nothing more I can do there as every script has to be examined.

Selecting an OAR showed the entire row selected. Now it is just the cell, Thanks AI Austin!


V3.3 - This is a general release and is in the Automatic Updater.

Opensim set to Released OpenSimulator version 0.9.1.1 Snail #7bdc408caca3. This changes some LSL constants so an automatic script cache clear will be done at first boot.

Content menu Load Free Oar and Load Free IAR pulls data at startup with images, licenses, and names of all free OARS and IARS. 

Inworld restarts of a region are always buggy. Now set so any Inworld Restart shuts down the entire Instance. You must set the the Auto Restart capability of DreamGrid to restart the sim.

Allow logins while scripts are loading which speeds up reboot.

UbODE: convex shape type on normal prims and sculpts enabled, and MeshFileCache enabled (UBODE only)

llCastRay set to V3 which Meshes prims for good accuracy in ray hit detection, handling basic and tortured prims, sculpts and meshes.
* Uses ellipsoid, correctly sized avatar capsules.
* Handles complex terrain, multi-prim objects and seated avatars.
* Implements throttling and the status codes RCERR_UNKNOWN and RCERR_CAST_TIME_EXCEEDED, so LSL scripts need to handle these responses and RCERR_SIM_PERF_LOW.

V3.299
New: Opensim updated to 066a6fbaa1 ("changes on lludp acks and resends", 2019-12-18) which hopefully will fix where you cannot see mesh and land when running a viewer.

Bug: MaxPort function had a bug in it that caused an occasional crash when adding a region.

Fix: Deregistering all regions was awkward to run as mysql had not been started.

New: Region Popup now has a View Log button.

Minor: An 'alert' was missing in one load oar 

Fix: Would never start a region if CPU > 75%. Was supposed to start after 1 minute wait.

Minor: Added more checks for bad region numbers.

Minor: Reduce region icon size to 20 px

Bug: No single quotes allowed in DOS box names as the Windows handler cannot grab hwnd PID with a single quote in the name. Regions can have single quotes in them.
V3.298
Restart, Error handler, and Shutdown logic changes after a DreamGrid restart where it has to find and re-attach to each region. This fixes the CPU usage = 0 and other glitches in the Region list. These occurred when DreamGrid was restarted with regions already running and it could not find the Process ID.
Global and Local Search uses V3HG links which work inside Singularity and Firestorm viewer, Media On A Prim, and in Web Links. Many thanks to AI Austin and 
Robust logging set back to INFO from DEBUG.
Ports are initialized sequentially only at boot. Adding a new region puts the port onto the end. This stops Region confusion when regions are added while system is running.
Regions > 4X4 in some cases would not load using the GUI.
Icecast port defaults changed to 8100-8102 for new users only.
Minor Start/Stopped button fixes when something goes wrong in a boot.
Icon size was off by 4 pixels in Region List which goofed up Large Screen mode

V3.297
Teleport signs could be fooled into showing offline regions if a region had crashed or been stopped without a quit command. Now they have to be both enabled and booted, too.
OAR menus refreshed every hour from Hyperica/Outworldz – no need to restart to get a new release of a Region.
Regions have an Override per region for Script Engine for X or Y Engine.
UBODE and Bullet are the remaining Script Engines
Diva Wifi updated to latest version which repairs problems in adding Default Avatars.
Load OAR 0.9 link was busticated.
New Categories for Publicity (and fixed the ones with commas).
Ports and Script Engines now show in Region Lists.
IF Apache is a service, leave MySQL running so PHP maps work.

V3.296
Added a Log->Error Log to the menu. This log is the first place to look when it crashes. Its always been there, just not in the menu. Doh!
Changes to the way it detects the process IDs of running Opensim. Added a single class to monitor all of them. Hopefully, this will eliminate some of the odd things that have been reported that happen on occasion, such as not closing he DOS windows, but only on first boot.
MySQL now stops when you click Stop. This helps prevent MySQL corruption. If Apache is running as a Service, MySQL, PHP, and Apache are left running, even when you exit so your map and home pages will still appear. Diva Wifi Web page is part of Robust, so it will not.
Tweaks to the 4 icons, including a new Red X Error Icon.
Updated Licenses to some of the downloadable OAR files to be absolutely clear which ones are exclusive to the Outworldz.
V3.295

Opensim Release 0.9.1.1 2019-12-03 14:27 #5c5e4bd8304dbb607a mantis 8632: stop triggering Changed on just scale checks

rm extra CRLF when first starting up and creating the first user.


V3.294
Publicity module (finally) lets you add descriptive text to your Hyperica Listing. Category setting where you can click one or more sections to appear in the new Destination Guide.
Fixed a lot of Unicode problems in Events and Search.
If a region responds when it is popped up onscreen after a click, make certain it also has a "running" icon.
Using Dot Net 4.6.1 (disabled legacy) features in Opensim since it is stable and the recommended setting. 
Minor changes to Send keys to try to make the 'q' key more reliable on obsolete Windows 7 machines.
V3.293
Bird module DLL was missing. Could lead to a crash if you updated from an older version and enabled birds.
V3.292
Aborted release - multiple issues with German Translation due to a newline that caused it to make crash tinkly noises.
The Region List form could be opened more than once due to a missing line of code.

V3.291
German Language translations by Ralf Burger, thank you!
Search module for local grids was broken. You need to add the path to PHP7 to the beginning of Path if you want to use local search. Global is fine.
A dozen more translations and some fixes for Globalization in forms for resizing. Unicode issues broke some things and could cause crashes.
Reordered the Search Menus to make better sense - thanks, Ai Austin!
Cleaned up all warnings about programming style that appeared in Studio 2019, so I can spot anything that might be important in the future.
Region List shows dashes (-) when the setting comes from the default, instead of a region override. This was only partly implemented before.
Implemented much more checking of human-entered values in places like the Birds form.
Added a Trouble shooting Guide to Help.

V3.29

You can click the round MySQL, Robust, Apache and Icecast status buttons to stop/start them. 
Avatar count was different in different displays.
Half-dozen new language Translations.
Was possible to have a Null Reference Exception when Booting a region if Stop button was clicked at the right time.
Busy/Start/Abort button fixes. Clicking Busy will force an Abort when shutting down.
Catch as many individual errors as it can when reading region INI files. It complains with details of what to fix, and aborts the launch.
Fix check if MySQL is running so Estates and Avatars will appear in region list.
Sequential/Timer Boot before running a next region, not after.
Precise CPU graph with a 4-second running average for Sequential/Timer - makes it bobble around 75% CPU when booting.
Added freeware program to Help 'cports.exe' Which can show all ports that are in use to help troubleshoot anti-virus and port glomming applications.
Open firewall as a separate thread for speed. Firewall has to run only if you change a region port setting, by adding or deleting, or on first start.
You cannot HG between two identical region locations. New systems change the "Welcome" region location from 1000,1000 to a random number from 1000 to 2000 to allow Hypergrid to other grids that have 1000,1000 set. Also sets the map center to the Welcome region location, whatever it is. Additional regions are added 4 to the right of the highest region as it did before.
Catch user 'blank' entries in Regions and Maps Settings.
"Allow Level Gods" was unchecked in Region Form, as it is based on the other settings being a null string, not "False".
Removed some unneeded logging that slowed down the system.
Warn if region location X,Y < 32, not possible to be that low in HG sims.
Enable Edit Button in Region Popup only if region is stopped.
Abort Handler reworked to end a race condition that should prevent occasional extra warnings on crashed regions. Also much faster to restart and recycle.
Codemaid extension in Visual Studio settings are saved in Git for multi-system development. Codemaid is a great tool for making the source consistent, but you need the same settings on each machine.
A Warm start is when you start DreamGrid on an already running Robust and set of regions. DG located into the Robust and regions as if it had already started them. Warm Starts after a "Just Quit" did not populate region handles list. This is fixed so RAM will now show up. Should also allow us to catch a crash after a Warm start.
I spell checked this document, finally. :-)

V3.28
Region List sometimes crashed the system when a race condition occurred after adding a region.
Region List now remembers the column widths for Detail view. 

V3.27
An Overall-Try-Catch in Application Events shows an error message and where the error occurred. Do not quit on an exception.
A missing or offline Welcome caused an issue - fixed
Added a Webstats button to region popup. It is enabled when the region is running
FSassets backup could cause a crash if folder did not exists
Suppressed several hundred warnings on Exceptions not being specific.
Remove compiled languages from git repo.

V3.26
Added 20 different language translations for 700+ phrases, resized many forms and prompts and tooltips to fix
Added YEngine and XEngine Switch

V3.25
Disable region Auto Backup added to region Overrides
Drop a useless old images to reduce size of exe
God mode fixes galore, reset defaults in Region INI to blanks
Added Overrides to Region List Details for carious Gods, Publicity and to skip region Auto Backup
Teleport hop link updated to hop in region list as secondlife link no longer works in Firestorm 6 series.
Clear script cache automagically if Opensim version or hash changes

V3.24
Updated to Released Opensim "0.9.1.1 Yeti "Server Release Notes" hash #defa235859889dbd". This is one patch past 0.9.1.0 for server release notes.

V3.23
Teleport to a region from within DreamGrid in the Region Start/Stop popup panel. 
Robust, Apache, Icecast and MySQL can be set to auto restart if they crash.
Update Mysq.Data.dll
Update Visual Studio 2017 to latest FXcops and reduce footprint on unused extension in Github
Removed embedded zip compressors for smaller footprint.
Drop unused icons

V3.22
Shorten boot time by being smart about Firewall updates. On an extremely fast machine, it takes 9 seconds to get to robust start. Firewall took up 31 seconds more. Now it takes 0 unless you add a region.
Restart Robust, Apache, MySQL, and Apache if Auto restart is Enabled

V3.21 
Saving a region and them immediately re-opening it did not show changes. The changes were saved to disk but not reloaded into RAM.
Rework the way ports increment from the starting number
Catch error in a crashed region that goes down while shutting down.
Strict type checking on some region variables. Integers, singles, and doubles versus strings.
Add Sean's latest Radio IAR to the free IAR collection
Y coordinate changed when X changed - was supposed to be region size.
God mode overrides fixed. They always overrode the global for Level 200 Gods to off, even if unselected.
Prevent a lower versus upper case issue if the puny human entered 'Autobackup'.

V3.2 Release Rollup
A wrong "print" caused a crash when a backup was manually run.
Always use English culture until translations are available.


V3.197
Local Search in Settings did not 'stick;
Add Visual C++ 2015 installers for PHP7
Local search was broken by PHP7 - missing explicit ossearch directive
Fix up local search PHP to use "Metromap/includes/config.php" database include

V3.196
Added Garry Beaumont's wrecked home Icon that shows when the Welcome region is disabled.
Missing PHP7 extension prevented PHP from making maps, links, or search.
Clearing asset cache when running did not work. It went to robust instead of the online regions. It worked if you were offline.
Added a Module for File/folder copy and delete to clean up warnings and catch all possible errors.
Apache Settings allowed both Local and Global search to be set. Now a toggle for one or the other.

V3.195
New updater process loads files in background to a specific zip file. You can choose to ignore this version. It will re-prompt the next release. 
Dot Net zip set back to be 1.11.0 to be compatible with older updater. This causes a crash in the DLL.

V3.194
Big speed up on registering DYN DNS
Speed up Saving regions
Move Apache to its own setting.

Metro Maps was missing an include
V3.194
Speed up Saving regions
Move Apache to its own setting.
Set Apache to only run programs in htdocs
Metro Maps was missing an include

V3.193 
Unchecking Apache as a Service removes the service
Bug in Email prevented it from emailing confirmation of a new user
Bug in Settings caused Clear Cache button to crash
Cache setting added to enable viewer caches.
Iconic Zip DLL embedded in exe for updates.

V3.192
Update PHP to PHP7
Add Home Icon for the Welcome region when it is booted
Detect running Opensim and add them to PID so we can stop them
Test with Joomla/JOpensim
Refactors for Region Type, Usings, RobustDBConnection

V3.191
Stupid Oops in Regions. Could not add a new region

V3.19 
Updated manual for upcoming 3.2 release
Fixed glitch in V3.18 in Cloud Density
Disallow Foreigners switch added per-region. This lets you keep assets in your grid by disallowing assets to leave, yet allowing HG visitors to come and go.
Disallow Resident switch added per-region. This allows only Region Owners and Estate Managers in any given region.
Checked all IM vars against Opensim source and made minor changes they may help with the offline IM's getting stuck. Port 8003 should not need to be opened to allow IM's.

V3.18
Export Checkbox in Settings->permissions to disallow export of prims from viewers. Default -> Allow
If an OAR is loaded into a Var region > 4X4, allow it.
Removed lots of warnings in Visual Studio 2019.

V3.17 is a release candidate for V3.2, the official release that everybody gets a notice to update to.
There is no longer an "updater versus installer". For backwards compatibility, there are still two files on the web server, but they are identical. 
If you want to start over with a blank database, you can just delete MySQL\data and it will be rebuilt as a blank system
New background updater process.
"Welcome to " & SimName() & " , <USERNAME>") set for welcome message.
Build process is much faster by using a temp folder instead of adding and deleting from a zip. Also easier to audit.
Put back support for older TLS 1.0 protocols so older systems can update.
Console Commands did not always pop open the DOS window
Load OAR in some earlier versions was borked.
GDI+ error when changing Publicity Photo is fixed
Snapshot, MinTimerInterval, Disable Gloebits fixed in region Overrides

Compile instructions updated.
Add help for ServerType, thanks to Garry Beaumont
Access of shared member through an instance; qualifying expression will not be evaluated refactored

V3.16 Beta
Search improvements for local and global search - sped up Datasnapshot interval, better HGV3 link that does not require a second click. Shows # hours each sim has been online in search, and dwell time (the Second Life visitor metric). 

V3.15 Beta 
Opensim Snail dev master #38dbc0328881 2019-08-31 14:36
Ctrl-R Region Form also shows the Estate name for each region
Search: Lots of new things! Search is integrated into Hyperica.com. You can look for Objects Marked for search in any Outworldz gird, or just your own. Also, locate Parcels, Grids, and regions in grids. These are only shown if the region owner chooses to enable search and the Prim Owner, region owner, or parcel owner has cheeked the "Show in Search button".
Added a new variable to Opensim Datasnapshot module to allow all grids to be searched.
Disable Search button added to Viewer Search. If on, you can set it so your residents see local only, or globally Search all Dream grids.
Datasnapshot collector starts 5 minutes after a boot to speed up collecting assets for search. Runs every hour after that locally.
Some Settings would not be placed into the Region or Opensim.ini files when changed unless you did a restart. Most changes to settings now re-write the region so it will boot correctly.
Import Dreamworld and "regular" Opensim INI files button in the Region Panel would not work if the file name did not match the [name] of the region. Fixed.
Changed Voice Help URL to match new Vivox web page for signup.
Windows can return a null PID from Process(). It should wait until there is a PID before returning. But nooooo it does not, so I added a fix to Boot () to make sure we have a valid PID so we can minimize windows. This may explain whey sometimes it does not type 'q' in certain windows.
Slow down the tests on quitting to prevent spamming the console.
Add more UPNP exception catchers to cover more brain-dead routers.
Major refactor of defaults for all region params to stop weird crashes on imported or brain-dead INI files. For example, a sim size of 0 was allowed by Opensim INI files. duh
Setting a new Publicity Photo could kill a system if the Hyperica server is offline or unreachable. Improve error handling here. There should be no dependency on any of my servers, except for optional services such as DYN DNS or search.
Updated Apache to latest security SSL/TLS 1.2 and made it refuse all obsolete ciphers like TLS 1.0 and 1.1. Tested as not being vulnerable to any common attacks such as Heart bleed.

V3.13 Beta
Repaired OsGrid and other region types that broke in prior beta version
Added a Disable Gloebits setting in region settings. This overrides the global setting if Gloebits are on.
Refactored a lot of internal settings to use native types and also set defaults for all variables in Regions.

V3.12 Beta
Sped up Opensim using Ubit's optimized Dot Net bug fix for Windows 1903 and compiled with dev master #5b39860573 2019-08-02 12:13:53
Robust logging set to INFO, as it was too noisy in DEBUG
Added auto-updating Sitemap.xml for htdocs and bin/data
Added Web Statistics button for many statistics for each region in the Region Panel
Auto firewall setup was missing the second Icecast Port
Fixed an issue where Apache could not run properly on ports other than 80
Datasnapshot was not registering in Local Search mode, which broke Local Search, and used wrong http port if it was changed.

V3.11 Beta
Aviworlds Region Server lets you attach to Aviworlds easily.
Added Restart Robust Button
Added logic to catch UPNP errors on some machines/routers.

V3.1 Released 7/29/2019
Backup no longer blocks operation of the system
Backup FSAssets, too.
Xbakes enabled
IM Offline works without having to open port 8003.
Firewall code typo put an extra Apache Http Port 80 in the firewall every start.


V3.06
PHP Maps and Search working for any MYSQL port. Older systems used port 3309 as 3306 was use by some for Sim-On-A-Stick or OsGrid/Metro.
Use port 8003 for Offline IM to fix a problem where IM's would loop endlessly in the Console
Save IAR was non functional when all the Handles got dropped.
Save IAR needs to find a running region. If the first region was found, the region was not popped up on screen. Old bug.
osGetGridGatekeeperURI enabled for teleport HUD by anybody.

V3.05 
Fixed doubled Auto teleports for Prim V2.5

V3.04 
Fixed a bug where the Auto Teleporters showed regions that are unmarked for teleports.
Opening Cache form with a lot of cache caused an exceedingly long pause. 
Fixed a case where Apache may not start reliably. 

V3.03
Added Help for FSAssets.
Added more visible help button to all forms.
Flotsam Cache variables can be changed to reduce disk space usage. See Settings->Caches.
System Backup has options for each type of backup to make and includes FSAssets data.
Added MinTimerInterval to each region INI file. Smallest value you should use is 1/11 of a second, as that is Opensim's internal Frame rate. 

V3.02
Added Windows 1903 patches for Dot net 4.8 that caused many issues with MOAP, and changing land settings.
Checkbox to enable FsAssets - a disk based De-duplicating Asset File system. I recommend you start your regions one at a time so they will be properly de-duplicated one time.
Reworked Region/OsGrid server to allow regions to have their own IP address. Usually you do not need to do anything to run a region server except to
add the DNS name and change the setting. But this fails if the region server is on a different network. See Ports section Help for details.
Auto Teleports now support multiple region servers. Avatar counts will not work on Region servers - no access to the data unless you edit robust settings and grant access to the robust server with special MySQL commands.
Added a catch-all Error message handler for any missed exceptions to catch unexpected crashes.
Flotsam cache can be adjusted in size with a new panel.
Allow the Partners to work on region server. Also updated the Steam punk TP and set the partners prim to full mod/copy.
SupportViewerObjectsCache -= true explicitly to help with missing prims, theoretically this does nothing as true is the default. See http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=8516

V3.01 
ExternalHostName added to the Port section for use on non-NATed Region servers.
Added Outworldz Teleport System V2.5.iar to the Local IAR. This teleporter supports more than 32 sims. Just change the description from 0 to 1, or 2 or 3, and reset the scripts.
Create Region Name could not be typed into at the ending. Trim() fixed. 
Moved KillAll scripts towards end of boot, and made it run only once.
Lowered Cache sizes to 4 hr from 48 and made it adjustable.

V3.0 
Functionally the same as V2.96 with some additional Help file tweaks.

V2.96
Allow more than one LCD screen in the Auto re-positioner/resizer
Enable Xbakes
Server Visitor screens by Garry Beaumont in Local IAR

God mode for level 200+ incorrect also set Region Owner gods to on.

V2.95
Compiled with Opensim Master 6-8-2019 #38e937f91b08a2e52 
Helps fix prims not being seen – if still losing them, lower your viewer bandwidth
Create inventory entries for textures uploaded with a model
MySQL could use up too many handles
Fixed %CPU to 2 digits on main screen
Databaseinfo.php and config.php are set automatically to match possible database user/password changes – used in Search, examples, and maps.
Stop printing extra '0 regions running' while it checks them all, just stop.
Add Microsoft Runtime for Visual C++ 2012 32 and 64 bit


V2.94
Fix a case issue on Partners that broke partnering prim

V2.93
Auto detect any loopback adapter named "Loopback", and set it up when the grid starts.
This set loopback adapters with the correct IP automatically.
V2.92
Correct the count of HG Avatars in Region List – was showing only the 1st one
Added a longer timeout to MySQL connections.
Drop Xbakes 
“real' check if sim is still shutting down by poking port.

V2.91 
Fixed nasty bug on Regions that caused crashes when region was renamed
Icons change in region list for 1 or more avatars
Allow oSSetDynamic texture and other settings so Aine Caoime’s (Anya Kee-vah) dance machine works for anyone.
Programmable Welcome Message on viewer screen
OsGrid and Metro support. 
Comes with MSFT signed installers for Apaches' necessary DLL's.
Bug in 3X3 load oar fixed where two of the tiles has wrong coordinates.
Deletes all old DLLs that are not in the list 'dll.txt'.
Installs for Microsoft C++ 1012 32/64 bit which are needed for Apache.
A UUID could be zeroed out, leading to a crash.

V2.90
Release of V2.89 with another DLL deleted.

V2.89
Try-catch a possible crash on events load if Outworldz web site is offline. There should never be any dependencies on having an external PC running except for ns1.outworldz.net for dynamic DNS and that only applies to outworldz.net users. DreamGrid pulls a list of available OARS, IARs, and events from Outworldz.com web site periodically, and these are dependent on Outworldz.com being online.
Removed bin\addins as it is old, unused, and may have old DLLS in it leading to mysterious crashes about log4net because log4net is now Dot net 4.6.

V.28
Add Gloebit back in.
Delete 11 DLL's left over from ancient updates.

V2.87
Compiled with Opensim Dev Master 4/24/2019 #11cad57c9cac5 
You should clear the script cache before starting this version as the large jump in Opensim code will likely lead to Script errors.
RegionReady set to localhost as Server2016 will run without Administrator mode.

V2.86 
Patched to fix Sequential Start. If on, nothing happened to delay the next sim from starting immediately but it should have waited for the previous sim to boot first, then start the next region. If off, CPU less than 75% is needed before the next sim will start or stop.

V2.85 
Link to web page takes you to http://yourgrid:80where the large map is, or 8002, depending upon whether Opensim is running, and if you have Apache web server enabled. 
Apache port is movable. If your ISP blocks :80, try :8000
Diagnostics loopback test reworked for Server 2016. 
Icons fixed on Server 2016 by moving port 8001 to listen to localhost only.

V2.84 
Search local or remote grids is now a global setting. Global is still being edited, as it has no grid info yet.
Paging, search, sort by columns in Search Objects.
Events re-added by a pull from Outworldz e very hour and on startup

V 2.83
Apache 2.4 and PHP 5 added - may be enabled by a new switch in Web Control panel. You can run HTML and JavaScript with it or host your own Port 80 Web pages, assuming your ISP allows port 80.
Hypergrid.org‘s “MetroMap” (large and small) added to the url http:://(grid):80/Metromap and to the Wifi Home Screen.
You can run 3rd party programs such as PhpMyAdmin, Strawberry Perl and other CGI programs by adding the application. 
Perl examples for Template::Toolkit and DBIX::Class to manipulate the database are included in the Apache\htdocs\PerlExamples folder.
PHP Examples are in the Apache\htdocs\Search folder for Classifieds, Logging, Dumping Objects, Parcels, Regions, and Hosts.
Objects and regions marked as ‘Show in Search’ are Searchable in the Viewer (Ctrl-F in Firestorm). Requires Apache and PHP Switch to be enabled in Web Pages. Classifieds do not work yet.
Load OAR defaults to all options off.
New Auto-Restart on Crash switch enabled by default.
New Auto-Restart on Bulletsim Crash.
Memory leak plugged 
Sort order sorted for X,Y and RAM in Region Panel by adding leading zeros.
Faster startup started faster by skipping phase II settings unless you have edited something.
Predefined Colored logs
Enable these colored logs by selecting Save on Exit option ‘To File in Application Directory’ 

2.82 
Disabling a region while shutting it down caused the Regions panel to not render.
Help always appeared for Load Oar 2X2
Added a PopUp for 1X1 so you can set more options.
Added back the View buttons to Regionlist and made them resize and re-position the list

2.81
Add Memory used for each region to Region panel
Add RAM graph
Add Avatar, CPU and RAM to front panel
Save width for Main Form

2.8 Release 
2.79E = 2.8

2.79A through E:
Avatar count shown on main form at upper right.
Prompts before shutting down if any avatars are in any region. So you can deliberately kill then all! bwuhahaha
Clear Caches was in Help, now is a Settings Button for consistency.
Baretail logging system with colorized text, live scrolling.
"View All Logs" loads all logs into Baretail as tabs. Baretail.exe in the root folder remembers them.
"View Region Log" fixed to show the DOS box log instead of the region, which only worked on the last region in a DOS box.
Scrolling text in Status panel.
Resizable main form.
CPU speed graph for last 3 minutes.
Improved PC firewall ports opened on start.
Turns off the DOS box Quickedit mode. If you clicked a DOS box, it paused which eventually crashes the sim. Works on Private or Public Networks, not Domain.
Regions panel added an Avatar view that shows a list of avatar names and the regions they are in. Double-clicking a name will start a teleport sequence to that avatar in your viewer.
Region Panel remembers the last view set, and will reappear after a restart if it was open. 
Many changes to Recycling and Auto restart. More icons for recycling regions. Recycle up and recycle down are single blue arrows, Bootup and Shutdown are double Blue arrows.

2.78
The Log viewer 'baretail' is included. It lets you colorize text, is zippy fast, and auto-scrolls to the latest entry, like Unix tail does.
Caps lock no longer interferes with console typing. I hate the Cap Lock Key. 
Load OAR options: 2x2, 3X3 and 4X4 clickable forms, with options for UserName & ForceMerge & ForceTerrain & ForceParcel & Displacement
Will abort Normalize regions if region locations will go negative or zero in X or Y.
Repositioned Web Maps for better fit to normalized region
Log level for robust set to INFO, instead of DEBUG, less spam, more speed.

2.77
Fix for Partners
Firewall Ports on PC are opened for you.
Robust 'create user' sent extra CRLF making it impossible to create the initial owner

2.76
Blank DNS name needs no password, becomes LAN IP.
Restart Region patch

2.75
Region Panel added some of the overrides and global region settings. These can be sorted as well.
Also, the Height and Width you last used are saved and restored.
Start/Stop/Restart All Buttons added to Region Panel
Region Chooser fixed to have New Name at top.

2.74 
Teleports 2.4 fix - these do not spam the console. Does not require any settings to be set such as allow LSL scripts. 
Allow LSL when checked, scripts lets you manually edit the Allowed IP Addresses in Opensim.proto
Start Regions Sequentially: Unchecked, the system starts a new region every few seconds. This can overwhelm the memory and CPU on slower systems.
UnChecked normally starts a new region if CPU is 75% or less. 
Checking this box will start them one at a time and wait for it to boot completely. It will wait up to 3 minutes per region, then move on.
Changes to Icecast ports or settings did not 'stick' would not overwrite file.
More Help on Loopback, Regions, Start/Stop

2.73
OAR file save would dump one region into all OARS. not just one
Sort Chooser screen
BaseURL was incorrect in some 2.72

2.72
Simple Google HTML Map added to http://localhost:8002/wifi/map.html
Allow only letters, numbers '.' and '-' in DNS names/IP Addresses
New User Home X,Y,Z: Users that create accounts on the web page will land at this spot on your Welcome region with their home set here so they can hypergrid back home.
Simplified INI constants updated from Jeff Kelly, thanks!
Suppress crash if Outworldz webserver is offline and you have Publicity checked - threaded apartment violation

2.71
Improvements to Start/Stop/Edit/Restart popup - no more double clicking effect
Try catch in case any ports were blanked out
MySQL Region port set to same as MySQL robust port on initial startup.
Removed several duplicated licenses.

2.7
Added AGPL license popup on first start

Modules:
 - Web stats module for grid ops
 - Server Release Notes Module by Fly Man adds these notes to Help About
 - Auto Restart Module by Fly Man. You can Auto Restart regions automagically with a timer. If no avatars are in the region, it will auto-reset periodically. This clears RAM used by visitors and helps maintain stability. 240 minutes (4 hours) is the default.
 - Birds Module by jonc and Jak Daniels: 

There is an IAR called !OpensimBirds.iar’ in the top of the Free Avatar Parts menu. Click it to load into your master avatar, just like any other IAR. To use this, log in and rez a bird from Objects/OpensimBirds. There are two types, SeaGull1 and SeaGull2. Type this onto the region console:

birds-prim SeaGull1 <enter> (or use SeaGull2, whichever bird you have put out)
birds-start<enter>

 You should see a flock of birds fly around you and gather into a flock. 

 To make the birds auto fly, edit Outworldzfiles\Opensim\bin\startup_commands.txt.example and add the same commands. Save the file as "startup_commands.txt" and restart the system. Your birds will start to fly immediately. This is System-Wide feature. To make it per-region, move the Birds.ini file into Opensim\bin\Regions\<Groupname>\<SomeRegionName>.

Console commands:

birds-start - Start Birds Flocking to region Welcome
birds-enable - Enable Birds Flocking to region Welcome
birds-disable - Disable Birds Flocking to region Welcome
birds-size <num> - Adjust the size of the flock to region Welcome
birds-prim <name> - Set the prim used for each bird to that passed in to region Welcome
birds-speed <num> - Set the maximum velocity each bird may achieve to region Welcome
birds-force <num> - Set the maximum force each bird may accelerate to region Welcome
birds-distance <num> - Set the maximum distance that other birds are to be considered in the same flock as us to region Welcome
birds-separation <num> - How far away from other birds we would like to stay to region Welcome
birds-tolerance <num> - How close to the edges of things can we get without being worried to region Welcome
birds-stats - Show birds stats to region Welcome
birds-framerate <num> - [debugging] only update birds every <num> frames to region Welcome
